Their inspiration might come from\nmany sources: Customer demand for data-informed product stories, rapidly changing economic,\nlabor and field conditions, and personal drive toward innovation, all of which can influence an\noperation. What is becoming clear is that one path to achieve these goals is powered by increased use\nof new agricultural technology, tools, and practices to create a “Smart Farming” experience.\nThe benefits to more tech-enabled agriculture are clear: more data at producer fingertips for making\ndecisions. Improved efficiency and profitability. Less wasted time and energy. Better information\nfor the supply chain, and consumers that are asking for it. The question now is: How can we help\nproducers get connected to the technology solutions that work best for them?\nFor Farm Journal’s “Smart Farming week”, Smart Farming was defined as a persistent management\nstrategy that empowers farmers and ranchers to collect, visualize and confidently act upon relevant\ndata insights to enable precise, efficient, and sustainable production of food, fuel, feed, and fiber.\nAny farmer, rancher or grower draws on their “field smarts” about what works on their operation,\nbut which producers are inclined to adopt Smart Farming technology solutions — and why? Farm\nJournal took a deep dive into the decision-making journeys of the most tech-forward farmers in our\ncommunity to provide some answers. The data referenced in this report is drawn from a variety of\nFarm Journal Intelligence products, representing row crop and livestock producers in 2023 and 2024.\n“Smart Farming means making your life more\nefficient, so you don’t have to focus on the mundane\nbut instead on making the best product possible ...\nWe only have so many hours in a day.”\n–Lucas Fricke, 6th generation Nebraska hog and row crop farmer",

    "content": "-- 3 of 36 --\n\nThe Toro Company is proud to present Basic Irrigation Design. This\nworkbook guides you, step-by-step, through the process of designing an\neffective and efficient irrigation system.\nIn order to understand the process of irrigation design, there must first be a\nfundamental knowledge of the important irrigation components and their\nrelationships to one another. Each element of an irrigation system has a\ndirect effect on how the system operates as a whole. If some components\nare undersized or misused, the system may not operate properly. This may\nresult in poor distribution of water and less-than-optimum growth for the\nplant material.\nWhen a project is designed and installed using the proper guidelines, the\nresult is an efficient, long-lasting irrigation system — a system of which you\ncan be proud.\nWhen asked to refer to the Toro Specification Catalog it means to use the\nmost current version of the the Toro Product Catalog available on-line or\nyour local profession Toro irrigation distributor.\nii\nBasic Irrigation Design ___________________________________________\n\u0003 Introduction\nNOTE\n\n-- 4 of 36 --",

    "content": "It is important to understand hydraulic principles before beginning an\nirrigation design. This section includes an explanation of water pressure,\nfriction loss and water velocities. When you understand hydraulics, you then\nunderstand the physical properties of water and how they affect the\noperation of irrigation systems.\nWater Pressure\nWater pressure is the force or exertion of water in a piping system. Pressure\nis created by increasing the height (downward force due to weight) of the\nwater or by using a mechanical booster pump. Pressure is measured in\npounds per square inch (PSI).\nOne gallon of water weighs 8.3 pounds. There are approximately 7.5 gallons\nof water in a cubic foot. Therefore, a cubic foot of water has a total weight of\n62.25 pounds. One cubic foot equals 1,728 cubic inches. When the weight\nof water in a cubic foot is converted to cubic inches, it weighs .036 pounds\nper cubic inch.\nBy multiplying the weight of one cubic inch\n(.036 pounds) by 12 inches, it produces a force\nof .433 PSI for one foot of elevation. The\npressure is measured at the base of the 12-inch\ncolumn, which is the same as a square inch that\nis 1 foot high.\nWhen the column of water increases in\nheight, the weight, force and pressure\nalso increase. By multiplying the\nheight of the water by .433 the\npressure can be calculated. Therefore,\na 100-foot column of water creates\n43.3 PSI.\n62.25 lbs./1728 cu. in. = .036 lbs./cu. in.\n2\nBasic Irrigation Design ___________________________________________\n\u0003 Hydraulics\n12\"\n1\"\n1\"\n0.036 x 12\" = .433 PSI\nFIGURE 1.1\nFIGURE 1.2\nWATER TOWER\nWater Level\n100'\n100' x .433 = 43.3 PSI",

    "content": "Static Pressure\nStatic pressure is the amount of water force that is measured in a closed or\nnon-flowing water system. This pressure is measured by attaching a pressure\ngauge to a hose faucet. With no water flowing in the piping system, static\npressure is determined. When there are no hose bibs from which to\nmeasure, a call to the local Public Works or Fire Department can usually\nprovide the static readings.\nOn a level site, the static pressure in the\nmain will be approximately the same as\nthe static pressure at the building.\nKnowing static pressure is\nessential before beginning any\ndesign.\nWhen water begins to flow in a piping\nsystem that was once static, the\npressure reading on the gauge will\ndrop. The pressure reading with water\nflowing is referred to as dynamic\npressure.\nFriction Loss\nFriction loss is the reduction in water pressure once water begins to flow\nthrough the piping system. Pressure loss occurs when flowing water comes\nin contact with the inside surface of the pipe and other devices. The rougher\nthe inside surface, the more friction loss it will create. Friction loss may also\noccur due to increased flow in the pipes.\nLoss of water pressure occurs when water flows through the following\ncomponents:\n\u0003 \tservice line\n\u0003 \twater meter\n\u0003 \tbackflow prevention device\n\u0003 \tmain line pipe\n\u0003 \tremote control valve\n\u0003 \tlateral line pipe\n\u0003 \tfittings\n\u0003 \tother devices on the system\nAn estimate of the amount of friction loss on the site is required prior to\ndesigning the system.\n3\n___________________________________________ Basic Irrigation Design\n\u0003 Hydraulics\nNOTES\nFIGURE 1.3\nNOTE\nWater Main = 60 PSI Static\nService Line\nWater Meter\nStatic Pressure\n(No Water Flowing)\nBuilding\nStatic Pressure\n60 PSI",

    "content": "Friction Loss (CONTINUED)\nOn a residential or small commercial water system, there is typically\n20 to 25 PSI loss due to friction from the water main to the last sprinkler.\nBy taking the known static water pressure and subtracting the estimated\nfriction loss, a maximum design operating pressure is determined for the\nsprinkler heads.\nFor example, if static pressure equals 60 PSI and the estimated friction loss is\n20 PSI, the maximum sprinkler design operating pressure should be between\n35 and 40 PSI.\nFriction losses in pipe are calculated using the following information:\n\u0003 \ttype of pipe\n\u0003 \tsize of pipe\n\u0003 \tlength of pipe\n\u0003 \tamount of water flowing through the pipe\nUse the Toro Specification Catalog to determine exact friction losses for different\ntypes of pipe, water meters and gate valves. Friction losses for 100-foot\nlengths of pipe are listed.

This section includes a field checklist and calculations used to\ndetermine available water.

Irrigation systems with proper head layout produce an even growth\nrate of plant material.\nThere are many ways to lay out sprinklers on a site. Each method will work\nas long as specific rules are applied to each layout. Many new designers\nbelieve there is only one way to place sprinklers on a site. This is not true!\nSprinkler coverage must overlap to effectively and efficiently irrigate\nan area.

The stronger the prevailing wind, the closer the sprinklers should\nbe spaced. In most situations, it is best to maintain a spacing of close to 50%\nof the diameter of the sprinkler throw, or 100% of the radius. This is often\nreferred to as \"head-to-head\" spacing.\nThe rules that must be followed when laying out sprinklers apply to the\ndifferent layout styles that are used.

    "content": "Square/Rectangular Layout\nThis layout is well-suited to very\ndefined, geometric spaces, such as\nsmall, rectangle-shaped yards, or\nsites divided by sidewalks and\nother paved areas.\nSquare/rectangular spacing of\nheads also protects all borders\nfrom overthrow of water by\nplacing sprinklers in the corners\nand along the perimeters. The\nremaining sprinklers are then used\nto fill between the corners evenly.\nThe primary rule for square/rectangular layout design is that the\nrecommended distance from one sprinkler to the next should not\nexceed the radius of the sprinkler.\nIn order to best fit the site, it may be necessary to adjust the spacing. It is,\ntherefore, acceptable to increase or decrease spacing of spray heads ± 1 foot.\nRotary sprinklers may be adjusted ± 3 feet. If the sprinkler spacing is\nincreased, do not increase the row spacing. Conversely if row spacing is\nincreased, do not increase sprinkler spacing.\nFor example, the Toro Product Catalog indicates that a Rotor sprinkler\ndischarges 3 GPM at 45 PSI with a radius of 40 feet. Therefore, the maximum\nrecommended spacing from one sprinkler to another is 40 feet (see Figure 3.3).\nThe maximum recommended row spacing is also 40 feet. After finding the\nspacing distance, it is acceptable, depending on the plant type and wind, to\nadjust spacing between sprinklers and rows to fit the site. This produces the\nrectangular shape in the layout.\nEquilateral Triangular Layout\nEquilateral Triangular layout means\nall sides are equal lengths. It is a\ngood choice for sites without\nborders or open areas where\noverthrow of water is not a\nproblem. The actual coverage from\ntriangular spacing of sprinklers\ntends to provide better overall\ncoverage versus square spacing.\nThe main disadvantage is the edge\nof coverage where an oddly spaced\nsprinkler will throw water beyond\nthe edge of the site.\t12\nBasic Irrigation Design ___________________________________________\n\u0003 Sprinkler Layout\nNOTES \u0004 = Rotor\n3.0 GPM @ 45 PSI = 40'\n40' (Row Spacing)\n40'\n(Sprinkler Spacing)\nNOTE\n\u0004 = Rotor\n3.0 GPM @ 45 PSI = 40'\n34.64' (Row Spacing)\nFIGURE 3.3\nFIGURE 3.4\n40'\n(Sprinkler Spacing)",

    "content": "Most designers space sprinklers at 50% to 55% of the sprinkler diameter using\ntriangular spacing. The row distance is then calculated by multiplying the\nactual distance between sprinklers by .866. This provides the recommended\ndistance to the next row. As with square spacing, these distances are\nrecommended, and similar adjustments can be made to suit the size and\nshape of the site.\nWhen using a Toro Rotor sprinkler set to 3 GPM operating at 45 PSI, the\nradius is 40 feet. Diameter equals two times the radius. Therefore, the\ndiameter is 80 feet. By taking 50% of the diameter (.50 x 80'), the calculated\ndistance between sprinklers is 40 feet. The row distance is calculated by\nmultiplying 40 feet by .866. This distance is calculated to be 34.64 feet.\nAdjustments can be made to compensate for specific site requirements.\nSteps for Laying Out Sprinklers\n1. Determine the static pressure of the site. Estimate the friction losses\nthrough the system and the design operating pressure of the sprinklers.\n2. Measure the site. Break the entire site into smaller geometric shapes for\ndifferent layouts and sprinklers. Consider plant material and varying\nwatering needs. Determine which layouts are best for the site: square,\nrectangular or triangular.\n3. Determine which sprinklers will be used, the operating pressure and the\nmaximum spacing.\n4. Identify the critical line of the site. This is the line of sprinklers that must\nprotect a border such as a street or building.\n5. Identify the critical corner of the first line of sprinklers (the combination\nof the critical line and an adjacent border). This could be the corner of\ntwo streets, or the corner of a street and driveway, sidewalk or\nneighboring property.\n6. Place the first sprinkler in the critical corner, then divide the distance of\nthe critical line to evenly space the remaining sprinklers. If square spacing\nis used, there should be a sprinkler in each corner with evenly spaced\nsprinklers in between. If the layout is triangular, the spacing may cause an\noddly placed sprinkler at the end.\n7. Lay out the next row of sprinklers along a second critical line, such as the\nedge of a building. Fill in the interior area with evenly spaced rows of\nsprinklers. Adjust the spacing of the sprinklers and rows to fit the site.\n13\n___________________________________________ Basic Irrigation Design\n\u0003 Sprinkler Layout\nNOTES",

This section covers the reasons for zoning an\nirrigation system and proper procedures. By zoning an irrigation system\nproperly, different requirements within the site are irrigated independently.\nWhen zoning an irrigation system, the designer groups sprinklers together to\nrun at the same time.\nIn the Available Water section in this workbook, we covered how to\ncalculate the most efficient amount of water through a water meter and\nservice line. Once this amount is determined, there should never be a\ndemand from any zone on the system greater than the supply capacity.\nIf the demand in a zone is greater than the calculated available\nwater, friction losses will increase throughout the system. The\nresult is sprinklers that perform at less-than-optimum pressure,\nreduced radius and possible dry areas.\nAll of the sprinklers in a zone are connected with lateral line pipe.\nThe remote control valve is\ninstalled upstream from the\nsprinklers and connects to the\nmain line pipe.\nAlthough flow is very\nimportant in determining the\nnumber of zones in a system,\nit is not the only reason to\ngroup sprinklers together.\nSome of the other\nconsiderations for zoning\ninclude:\n1. \tGrouping similar\nsprinklers with the same\nprecipitation rate.\n2. \tSeparating varying plant\nmaterial into different\nzones.\n3. \tIrrigating sloped areas\nseparately from level areas.\n4. \tZoning shaded areas\nseparately from sunny\nareas.\n5. \tCreating different zones for\nvarying soil conditions.\n16\nBasic Irrigation Design ___________________________________________\n\u0003 Zoning A System\nWater\nMeter\nBackflow\nPrevention\nDevice\nMain Line Pipe\nLateral Line Pipes\nRemote Control Valve\nMain Line\nPipe\nRemote\nControl\nValve\nLateral Line Pipes\nNOTE\nFIGURE 4.1",

    "content": "Pipe Routing\nOnce it has been decided which groups of sprinklers will run together, the\nnext step is to route the pipe. Routing connects the heads within a zone on\nthe lateral line pipe and the valves to the water source on the main line pipe.\nThe lateral lines should be placed between the sprinklers and the valve\nlocation. It is usually best to run the lateral lines along the rows of sprinklers.\nThis is especially true if the spacing is triangular in layout. The best pattern\nof piping looks like an “H” when designed properly. On slopes, the lateral\npipe should run horizontally along the contours of the slope, not up and\ndown. This minimizes pressure variations due to elevation changes within\nthe zone.\nLocating Valves\nThe remote control valves can be placed independently within the site\n(remote location) or grouped together with other valves (manifolding).\nRemote location of\nvalves produces\nminimal runs of lateral\nline pipes. This\nreduces friction loss\nand also allows the\nplacement of valves in\nthe optimum hydraulic\nlocations within the\nsystem. The\ndisadvantages of\nremote location\ninclude difficulty in\nlocating valves on the\nsite after construction as well as an increased chance of damage to a valve or\nvalve box from maintenance equipment.\nManifolding valves requires less wire from the valves to the controller\nlocation, and the valves are easily located for troubleshooting. Usually, the\nmanifolded valves are located outside the landscaped or maintained area.\nTherefore, there is a reduced chance that damage may be caused by\nmaintenance equipment. The main disadvantage of manifolding is that more\npipe is needed to run from the valves to the sprinkler locations.

    "content": "The purpose of sizing pipe correctly is to ensure that the pipe delivering water\nto the sprinkler carries the required flow without excessive friction loss. In\nthis section, the steps for properly sizing irrigation lateral and main line pipes\nare outlined. When pipe is sized properly, the irrigation system flows water at\nsafe velocities with minimal friction losses.\nThere are several methods to determine the proper pipe size. One of the\nmost common is the velocity method. Using the velocity method, the\ndesigner limits the speed in each segment of pipe supplying water to the\nsprinklers. The most agreed upon speed limit of water flow in pipe is 5 FPS.\nBy limiting the speed to under 5 FPS, friction losses are also kept to a\nminimum.\nThe process of sizing pipe using the velocity method is as follows:\n1. Begin at the sprinkler farthest from\nthe remote control valve. Check\nthe gallonage of the sprinkler at the\nestimated design operating\npressure. This information comes\nfrom the Toro Specification Catalog\nnozzle data.\n2. Choose the type of pipe needed\nfor the system, for example,\nSDR 21 CLASS 200 PVC. Refer to\nthe Velocity of Flow Chart in the\nToro Specification Catalog.\n3. Read down the far left column\nunder FLOW GPM. Follow until\nthe GPM of the sprinkler used in\nthe design of the system, at its\noperating pressure, is located. To\nthe right of this GPM, locate the\nsmallest pipe size which flows the\nwater under 5 feet per second.\n4. Continue adding the GPM from upstream sprinklers to each segment of\npipe. Follow Step 3 for all segments. The pipes will increase in size\ncloser to the remote control valves.\n5. Valves are sized using the total GPM flow demand from all downstream\nsprinklers. Refer to the Toro Specification Catalog for valve sizing. Once\nthe valve type is selected, it is sized by referring to the pressure loss\ncharts in the Toro Specification Catalog As velocity of water is limited in\nthe pipes, there is a limit of allowable friction loss in the valve.\n20\nBasic Irrigation Design ___________________________________________\n\u0003 Pipe Sizing\n5 GPM Sprinkler Heads\n1\" Water Meter\n11\n⁄2\" Main Line\nNote: All pipe CL 200 PVC\n1\" Zone Valve (Angle)\n1\"\n11\n⁄2\"\n1\n⁄2\"\t3\n⁄4\"\nFIGURE 5.1",

The same is done for the pressure loss in the\nmainline fittings.\nExamine the following calculations for the example:\nPressure Loss From Friction per 100’ of Pipe (lbs./sq. in.)\nSDR 21 / Class 200 PVC 1120, PVC 1220, PVC 2120 \tC = 140\nFlow GPM \t1\n⁄2 \t3\n⁄4 \t1 \t11\n⁄4 \t11\n⁄2 \t2 \t21\n⁄2 \t3 \t4\n1 \t0.25 0.07\n2 \t0.90 0.24\n3 \t1.90 0.52\n4 \t3.24 0.88 0.26\n5 \t4.89 1.33 0.39\n6 \t6.86 1.86 0.55\n7 \t9.12 2.47 0.73\n8 \t11.68 3.17 0.94 0.30\n9 \t14.53 3.94 1.17 0.37\n10 \t17.66 4.79 1.42 0.45 0.23\nSection A: 4.89 psi/100ft x 50ft = 2.445 = 2.45 psi loss\nSection B: 4.79 psi /100ft x 50ft = 2.395 = 2.40 psi loss\nSection C: 3.38 psi/100 ft x 25ft = 0.845 = 0.85 psi loss\nSection D: 2.62 psi/100 ft x 50ft = 1.31 psi loss\nSection E: 2.45 psi/100 ft x 25ft = 0.6125 = 0.62 psi loss\nTotal Lateral Pipe PSI Loss\nPSI Loss in Lateral Fittings 7.63 x 0.10\nTotal Lateral Line PSI Loss\n= 7.63 psi loss\n= 0.77 psi loss\n= 8.40 psi loss",

Supplemental irrigation is also vital to produce accept-\nable quality and yield of crops on croplands in semi-arid and subhumid\nclimates during seasonal droughty periods. The complete management of\nirrigation water by the user is a necessary activity in our existence as a\nsociety. Competition for a limited water supply for other uses by the public\nrequire the irrigation water user to provide much closer control than ever\nbefore. The importance of irrigated crops is extremely vital to the public's\nsubsistence.\nToday's management of irrigation water requires using the best information\nand techniques that current technology can provide in the planning, design,\nevaluation, and management of irrigation systems. Support for many of the\nvalues included in this chapter come from field research, established design\nprocesses, and many system designs and evaluations over many years. Field\nevaluations must always be used to further refine the planning, design,\nevaluation, and management process. This design guide in the Natural\nResources Conservation Service (NRCS), National Engineering Handbook\nseries provides that current technology.\nIrrigation Guide, Part 652, is a guide. It describes the basics and process for\nplanning, designing, evaluating, and managing irrigation systems. It pro-\nvides the process for states to supplement the guide with local soils, crops,\nand irrigation water requirement information needed to plan, design, evalu-\nate, and manage irrigation systems.\nIrrigation Guide, Part 652, is a new handbook to the family of references in\nthe NRCS, National Engineering Handbook series. It is written for NRCS\nemployees who provide technical assistance to the water user with con-\ncerns for both water quantity and quality. Other technical personnel for\nFederal, State, private, and local agencies will also find the guide useful as a\nbasic reference when providing technical assistance relating to planning,\ndesigning, evaluating, and managing irrigation systems. College and univer-\nsity instructors will also find the guide useful as a classroom reference.\nIn addition to the irrigation Guide (part 652), chapters in the National\nEngineering Handbook irrigation section (now part 623) describe:\n• Soil-plant relationships and soil water properties that affect move-\nment, retention, and release of water in soil\n• Irrigation water requirements\n• Planning farm irrigation systems\n• Measurement of irrigation water\n• Design of pumping plants\n• Design criteria and design procedures for surface, sprinkler, and\nmicro irrigation methods and the variety of systems for each method\nthat can be adaptable to meet local crop, water, and site conditions\nand irrigation concerns",

It is a principal consider-\nation in the NRCS Conservation Management System\napproach to conservation planning on irrigated crop-\nland, hayland, and pastureland. Irrigation must be\ncomplemented with adequate management of nutri-\nents and pesticides, tillage and residue, and water.\nProper water management results in conservation of\nwater quantities, maintenance of onsite and offsite\nwater quality, soil chemical management (salinity,\nacidity, applied fertilizers, and other toxic elements),\nand irrigation related erosion control.\nFor the farm manager, benefits must justify the costs\nof purchasing and operating the irrigation system and\nthe time required to adequately operate, manage, and\nmaintain the irrigation system while leaving a reason-\nable return on investment. For the groundskeeper,\npark or landscape superintendent, nursery grower, or\nhomeowner, irrigation must maintain the desired\ngrowth of grass, ornamentals, flowers, and garden\ncrops while minimizing costs, labor, inefficient water\nuse, and nutrient and chemical losses.\nEscalating costs of energy used for pumping makes\nevery acre-inch of excess water a concern to many\nirrigators. Improving and maintaining pumping plants,\nirrigation equipment, irrigation application efficien-\ncies, and following an irrigation scheduling program\ncan lead to significant reductions in pumping costs.\nEscalating costs of farm equipment, fuel, seed, fertil-\nizer, pesticide, and irrigation equipment also make\nevery irrigation and field operation a financial concern\nto the farmer. Field operations should be limited to\nthose necessary to grow a satisfactory crop. Conserva-\ntion irrigation typically reduces:\n• Overall on-farm energy use\n• Soil compaction, which affects root develop-\nment and water movement\n• Water quantities used\n• Opportunity for ground water and surface\nwater pollution\n652.0100 \tPurpose and\nobjective\nThe Irrigation Guide provides technical information\nand procedures that can be used for successful plan-\nning, design, and management of irrigation systems. It\nis a guide only and does not imply or set Natural\nResources Conservation Service (NRCS) policy.\nIrrigation systems should apply the amount of water\nneeded by the crop in a timely manner without waste\nor damage to soil, water, air, plant, and animal re-\nsources. This includes, but is not limited to, offsite\nwater and air quality and desired impacts on plant and\nanimal (including fish and wildlife) diversity. Other\nbeneficial uses of irrigation water are frost protection,\ncrop quality, crop cooling, chemigation, desirable\nsaline and sodic balance maintenance, and leaching of\nundesirable soil chemicals.\nThe Irrigation Guide includes current information and\ntechnical data on irrigation systems and hardware,\nautomation, new techniques, soils, climate, water\nsupplies, crops, tillage practices, and farming condi-\ntions. Included are irrigation related technical data for\nsoils and irrigation water requirements for crops. In\nsome instances statements are based on field experi-\nences of the primary authors.\nThe objective of this guide is to assist NRCS employ-\nees in providing sound technical assistance for the\nmaintenance of soil productivity, conservation of\nwater and energy, and maintenance or improvement of\nthe standard of living and the environment. Basic data\nused will help ensure the planned irrigation system is\ncapable of supplying the amount of water needed by\nplants for planned production and quality during the\ngrowing season. Procedures for optimizing use of\nlimited water supplies are also included.\nPlanning for an irrigation system should take into\naccount physical conditions of the site, producer\nresources, cropping pattern, market availability, water\nquantity and quality, and effects on local environment.\nEconomics should provide the basis for sound conser-\nvation irrigation decisions, but may not be the ultimate\nconsideration. This is because many other factors may\ninfluence final decisions.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIntroduction\tChapter 1\n1–2 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nApplying water too soon or in excess of crop needs\nresults in inefficient irrigation application. Too often\nirrigation decisionmakers subscribe to \"when in doubt\nirrigate,\" rather than scheduling irrigations based on\nsoil moisture monitoring and measured crop need.\nAnother factor leading to inefficient water use is the\nuse-it-or-lose-it perception. Some irrigators and irriga-\ntion districts feel they must divert and use all the\nwater allocated to them whether they need it or not.\nThis can result in less than desired crop yield and\nproduct quality. It also increases leaching of nutrients,\ntoxic elements, and salts below the root zone and\nincreases the potential for erosion.\nThe direct cost of water to irrigators, when the water\nis supplied by irrigation companies or irrigation dis-\ntricts, varies between $5 and $600 per acre per year. In\nmany areas, however, water is relatively low in cost.\nLow cost water can lead to inefficient use if an irriga-\ntor uses a convenient application time rather than\nproviding the labor to fully manage the water.\n652.0102 \tSoil conserva-\ntion, water quality, and\npollution abatement\nIrrigation induced soil erosion is a problem on specific\nsoils in certain areas. Soil erosion can take the form of\nwind erosion when smooth and bare ground occurs\nbetween harvest and new crop growth periods. Soil\nerosion by water can result from high application rates\nin the outer part of center pivot systems, excessive\nfurrow or border inflows, and uncontrolled tailwater\nor runoff. The use of surface irrigation on moderately\nsteep to steep topography or leakage in the delivery\nsystem can also cause soil erosion by water.\nSoil erosion can produce sediment loads in irrigation\nditches, drains, tailwater collection systems, roadside\nditches, streams, and reservoirs. Sometimes it takes\ncareful study of a site to realize that erosion is taking\nplace. Soil erosion on irrigated fields generally can be\ncontrolled by careful planning, proper design, and\nadequate water, soil, and residue management. Offsite\nsediment damages are often a result of soil erosion from\ncropland, tailwater ditches, and surface water drains.\nPollution of ground and surface water by agricultural\nchemicals in irrigation water runoff or deep percola-\ntion is an increasing problem. Higher amounts of\nfertilizers are being used today than in the past.\nChemigation can improve the application of chemicals\nthrough sprinkler systems, but can also create poten-\ntial environmental problems through spills and im-\nproper or careless application. Leached chemicals,\nincluding salts in irrigation water, can degrade ground\nand surface water qualities. All of these problems can\nbe minimized by proper planning, design, system\noperation, and water management.\nInefficient irrigation can have offsite benefits. Wetland\nhabitat can be created from conveyance system leak-\nage and application of excess irrigation water. How-\never, excess irrigation water may contain undesirable\nor toxic organic or inorganic chemicals. In some parts\nof the United States, local, State, and Federal regula-\ntions are such that no irrigation runoff or subsurface\ndrainage effluent from irrigation practices shall enter\npublic water. In these areas irrigation runoff must be\ncontained onsite, reused, or disposed of safely.",

This guide contains sound water and\nirrigation system management concepts. It is a dy-\nnamic document available in computer electronic files\nor looseleaf form. As new, revised, or area-specific\ninformation becomes available, the guide can and\nshould be updated. Irrigation is a rapidly evolving\nscience and industry. Frequent revisions and additions\nare expected.\n(a) Using irrigation procedures\nThe best available procedures and data should always\nbe used, whether they are included in this irrigation\nguide or available elsewhere, for example, from Agri-\ncultural Research Service, Universities, Cooperative\nExtension Service, Bureau of Reclamation, or private\nindustry.\nNot all tables, charts, and procedures available in\nother readily available references are duplicated in the\nguide. Also, areas of the guide that describe proce-\ndures may not include all the processes and material\nneeded to carry out the procedure. For instance, to\nperform a side roll sprinkler system design requires\nthe use of National Engineering Handbook, Section 15,\nChapter 11. However, most references referred to in\nthe guide are available for field office use.\nA personal library or reference folder(s) containing\nspecific data and examples is recommended for tech-\nnicians performing procedures. This library can be\nused until computer software programs are available\nand can then be used as a reference when the proce-\ndure is accomplished. Such a library or reference\nfolder(s) can contain the following types of material:\n• Irrigation guide tables, charts, references,\nprocedures, materials, and forms, including\nexamples.\n• Tables for local climate, soils, crops, and plant\nwater requirements.\n• Available tables and figures from the National\nEngineering Handbook, Part 623, Irrigation.\n• Information or aids from other sources for\nplanning, design, management, and system\nevaluation.\n• Previous jobs that have been designed, docu-\nmented and approved.\n(b) Using worksheets\nThe use of worksheets in this guide is optional. They\nshould only be used if they are advantageous in saving\nplanning time and providing documentation. Only\nthose parts of the worksheets that apply to the particu-\nlar job should be used. Blank master worksheets are\nincluded in chapter 15 of this guide.",

The parameters include:\n• Estimated available water capacity by horizons\nor 1 foot (0.3 meter) increments\n• Water intake characteristics for furrow and\nborder (basins) irrigation\n• Intake rates or maximum application rates for\nsprinkle irrigation\n• Up-flux or upward water movement in soil\nSpecific local soils and their characteristics pertaining\nto irrigation are included in the state supplement\nsection.\nChapter 3, Crops—This chapter describes the crop\ncharacteristics pertaining to irrigation; i.e., growth\ncharacteristics, rooting depth, and moisture extraction\npatterns, Management Allowable Depletion (MAD)\nlevels, and effects of temperature, sodicity, and salin-\nity. Management, including critical irrigation and\nmoisture stress periods for plants and other special\nirrigation considerations, is included as a primary\nirrigation tool.\nCrops respond to irrigation when rainfall does not\nmaintain favorable soil moisture levels. When rainfall\nevents are spaced too far apart for optimum plant-\nwater conditions, plant biomass, yields, and quality are\naffected. Knowledge of actual crop rooting depths,\nwater requirements at different growth stages, critical\nmoisture stress periods, crop temperature modifica-\ntion effect, seed germination, and pesticide control are\nall necessary in determining when and how much\nwater to apply.\nChapter 4, Water Requirements—This chapter\ndescribes methods for determining crop evapotranspi-\nration (ET c) and net irrigation water requirement.\nWater budget and balance analysis use are also de-\nscribed. Estimated evapotranspiration values for peak\ndaily, monthly, and seasonal periods for locally grown\ncrops are included in the state supplement section.\n(c) Irrigation and distribution\nsystems\nChapter 5, Selecting an Irrigation Method (Sur-\nface, Sprinkle, Micro, or Subsurface)—This\nchapter includes factors that affect irrigation method\nselection and system adaptation. The factors are\nlargely functions of crop selection and rotation, soils,\ntopography, climate zone, tillage practices, labor\navailability (including skills), economics, water avail-\nability in quantity and quality, type of delivery sched-\nule, and the irrigation decisionmaker’s personal\npreference.\nChapter 6, Irrigation System Design—Criteria\nand references for the implementation of the more\ncommonly used irrigation methods and applicable\nsystems are included in this chapter.\nChapter 7, Farm Distribution Components—This\nchapter describes alternatives and various compo-\nnents of the farm distribution system. Water measure-\nment should be a part of any distribution system as it\nis the key to proper water management.",

New techniques for\nirrigation scheduling and system automation are\navailable and are a part of the information in this\nchapter. Field and climatic data should be accurately\ncollected and an analysis of irrigation need, timing,\nand application amount made available to the irrigator\npromptly. Procedures for establishing soil intake\ncharacteristics and evaluation of existing irrigation are\ndescribed.\nChapter 10, Conservation Management Systems\nand Irrigation Planning—This chapter contains\nthe basic steps for planning ecosystem-based resource\nmanagement systems including irrigation system\nplanning. The planning process as it pertains to irri-\ngated cropland is described.\nChapter 11, Economic Evaluations—This chapter\nincludes the criteria that can be used in evaluating\npumping plant operating costs. It also describes the\nprocedures for making economical pipe size determi-\nnations and other economic factors and processes that\ncan be used in planning.\nChapter 12, Energy Use and Conservation—This\nchapter reviews alternative energy sources and costs\nused in pumping and gives examples of irrigation\nsystem comparison and tillage and residue manage-\nment that relate to overall on-farm energy require-\nments. Improving water management almost always\ndecreases water and energy use except where inad-\nequate irrigation has occurred and more water is\nneeded to meet yield and quality objectives.\nChapter 13, Quality of Water Supply—Quality of\nwater to be used for irrigation of crops is briefly de-\nscribed in this chapter. To meet crop yield and quality\nobjectives, a reliable supply of high quality water is\ndesired. However, with proper management, applying\nsaline water on salt tolerant crops, liquid waste from\nagricultural related processing and products, treated\nmunicipal sewage effluent, and other low quality water\nshould be considered as an irrigation water source.\nChapter 14, Environmental Concerns—A direct\nrelationship can be established between downstream\nwater quality and irrigation. This relationship is pre-\nsented in chapter 14. Improper selection of an irriga-\ntion method and system for a given site or the misman-\nagement of any system can result in poor water distri-\nbution uniformity, soil erosion, excessive runoff, and\nexcessive deep percolation. Runoff can carry agricul-\ntural chemicals and plant nutrients in solution or\nattached to soil particles (e.g., phosphates). Excess\nirrigation water moving below the plant root zone\n(deep percolation) can carry soluble salts, nutrients\n(nitrates), pesticides, and other toxic elements that\nmay occur in the soil profile. Excess irrigation water\nand whatever it contains in solution generally ends up\neither as ground water recharge or returns to down-\nstream surface water.\n(e) Special tools\nChapter 15, Resource Planning and Evaluation\nTools and Worksheets—Included in this chapter are\naids, tools, and processes that can facilitate irrigation\nsystem planning, design, and evaluations.

Many of these factors directly influence the\nsoil’s ability to store, infiltrate, or upflux water deliv-\nered by precipitation or irrigation (including water\ntable control). The irrigation system(s) used should\nmatch all or most of these conditions.\nMany conditions influence the value of these factors.\nThe estimated values for available water capacity and\nintake are shown as rather broad ranges. Working\nwith ranges is a different concept than used in previ-\nous irrigation guides. In the field, ranges are normal\nbecause of many factors. The values in local soils data\nbases need to be refined to fit closer to actual field\nconditions. The actual value may vary from site to site\non the same soil, season to season, and even throughout\nthe season. It varies throughout the season depending\non the type of farm and tillage equipment, number of\ntillage operations, residue management, type of crop,\nwater quality, and even water temperature.\nSoils to be irrigated must have adequate surface and\nsubsurface drainage. Internal drainage within the crop\nroot zone can be either natural or from an installed\nsubsurface drainage system.\nThis guide describes ways to interpret site conditions\nfor planning and design decisions. Where necessary,\nactual field tests should be run to determine specific\nplanning and design values for a specific field. Evalua-\ntion results can also be used to fine tune individual\nirrigation system operations and management. When a\nparticular soil is encountered frequently in an area,\nefforts should be made to gather field data to verify\nthe site conditions or to use in refining values in the\nguide. These field derived values should be added as\nsupport for data presented in the guide.\n652.0201 \tGeneral\nSoil consists of mineral and organic materials, cover-\ning much of the Earth’s surface. It contains living\nmatter, air, and water, and can support vegetation.\nPeople have altered the soil in many places. Soil is one\nof the resources of major concern to USDA and the\nNatural Resources Conservation Service. The soil\nfunctions as a storehouse for plant nutrients, as habi-\ntat for soil organisms and plant roots, and as a reser-\nvoir for water to meet evapotranspiration (ET) de-\nmands of plants. It contains and supplies water, oxy-\ngen, nutrients, and mechanical support for plant\ngrowth.\nSoil is a basic irrigation resource that determines how\nirrigation water should be managed. The amount of\nwater the soil can hold for plant use is determined by\nits physical and chemical properties. This amount\ndetermines the length of time that a plant can be\nsustained adequately between irrigation or rainfall\nevents, the frequency of irrigation, and the amount and\nrate to be applied. Along with plant ET, it also deter-\nmines the irrigation system capacity system needed\nfor desired crop yield and product quality.\n(a) Soil survey\nNRCS is responsible for leadership of the National\nCooperative Soil Survey. Partners include other Fed-\neral, State, and local agencies and institutions. Soil\nsurvey data and interpretations have information that\ncan be used for planning, design, and management\ndecisions for irrigation.\nSoil map units represent an area on the landscape and\nconsist of one or more soils for which the unit is\nnamed. Single fields are rarely a single map unit or a\nsingle soil. Many soil map units include contrasting\nsoil inclusions considered too minor to be a separate\nmap unit. Because of variations in soil properties that\nexist in map units, additional onsite soils investiga-\ntions are often needed.",

Shallow tillage practices can affect\nwater infiltration and soil permeability rates. These\nproperty changes may not be reflected in the map unit\ndescription. Personnel doing irrigation planning are\nexpected to obtain accurate onsite soil information to\nmake recommendations. Adjacent farms may need\ndifferent recommendations for the same soil series\nbecause different equipment, tillage practices, and\nnumber of tillage operations are used.\n(b) Soil survey data base\nSoil survey data are available from the local National\nSoil Information System (NASIS) Map Unit Interpreta-\ntion Record (MUIR) soil data base on the Field Office\nComputing System (FOCS). Irrigation related software\napplications access this data base through a soil char-\nacteristics editor to create point data located within a\nfield or operating unit. Where maximum and minimum\nranges of soil attribute data are contained in the data\nbase (for example, percent rock or available water\ncapacity), the editor can be used to select or input the\nappropriate value. If a soil profile has been examined\nin the field, then data for the profile are entered in-\nstead of using the data base. Soil data points created in\nthis way can be used to create summary soil reports,\nor the data can be used directly either manually or in\nirrigation related software applications.\n(c) Soil limitations for irrigation\nExhibit 2–1 displays soil limitations when determining\nthe potential irrigability of a soil. It displays specific\nlimits and restrictive features for various soil proper-\nties; however, it does not necessarily mean the soil\nshould not be irrigated. A restriction indicates there\nare limitations for selection of crops or irrigation\nmethod and will require a high level of management.\nSome restrictions may require such an excessive high\nlevel of management that it may not be feasible to\nirrigate that soil. Likewise, a deep well drained loamy\nsoil with minor restrictions can become nonirrigable\ndue to poor water management decisions and cultural\npractices.",

Total\nwater held by a soil is called water holding capacity.\nHowever, not all soil-water is available for extraction\nby plant roots. The volume of water available to plants\nthat a soil can store is referred to as available water\ncapacity.\n(1) Available Water Capacity (AWC)\nThis is the traditional term used to express the amount\nof water held in the soil available for use by most\nplants. It is dependent on crop rooting depth and\nseveral soil characteristics. Units of measure are\nexpressed in various terms:\n• Volume unit as inches of water per inch or per\nfoot of soil depth\n• Gravimetric percent by weight\n• Percent on a volume basis\nIn fine textured soils and soils affected by salinity,\nsodicity, or other chemicals, a considerable volume of\nsoil water may not be available for plant use.\n(2) Soil-water potential\nSoil-water potential is a more correct way to define\nwater available to plants. It is the amount of work\nrequired per unit quantity of water to transport water\nin soil. In the soil, water moves continuously in the\ndirection of decreasing potential energy or from higher\nwater content to lower water content. The concept of\nsoil-water potential replaces arbitrary gravitational,\ncapillary, and hygroscopic terms. Total water potential\nconsists of several components. It is the sum of\nmatric, solute, gravitational, and pressure potential.\nRefer to the National Engineering Handbook (NEH),\nSection 15, Chapter 1, Soil-Plant-Water Relationships\nfor a detailed explanation of this concept.\nThe soil-water potential concept will become more\nintegrated into field procedures as new procedures\nevolve. For practical reasons, the terms and concepts\nof field capacity and permanent wilting point are\nmaintained. Units of bars and atmospheres are gener-\nally used to express suction, tension, stress, or poten-\ntial of soil water.\n(i) \tField capacity—This is the amount of water a\nwell-drained soil holds after free water has drained\nbecause of gravity. For coarse textured soil, drainage\noccurs soon after irrigation because of relatively large\npores and low soil particle surface tension. In fine\ntextured soil, drainage takes much longer because of\nsmaller pores and their horizontal shape. Major soil\nproperties that affect field capacity are texture, struc-\nture, bulk density, and strata within the profile that\nrestrict water movement. Generally, fine textured soil\nholds more water than coarse textured soil. Some\nsoils, such as some volcanic and organic soils, are\nunique in that they can retain significant volumes of\nwater at tensions less than one-tenth bar, thereby\ngiving them a larger available water capacity.\nAn approximation of field capacity soil-water content\nlevel can be identified in the laboratory. It is the water\nretained in a soil when subjected to a tension of one-\ntenth atmosphere (bar) for sandy soils and one-third\natmosphere for other finer textured soils.\nField capacity water content level can be estimated in\nthe field immediately following a rain or irrigation,\nafter free water has drained through the soil profile.\nSome judgment is necessary to determine when free\nwater has drained and field capacity has been reached.\nFree water in coarse textured soils (sandy) can drain\nin a few hours. Medium textured (loamy) soils take\napproximately 24 hours, while fine textured (clayey)\nsoils may take several days.\n(ii) Permanent wilting point—This is the soil-\nwater content at which most plants cannot obtain\nsufficient water to prevent permanent tissue damage.\nThe lower limit to the available water capacity has\nbeen reached for a given plant when it has so ex-",

The water\ncontent in the soil is then said to be the permanent\nwilting percentage for the plant concerned.\nExperimental evidence shows that this water content\npoint does not correspond to a unique tension of 15\natmospheres for all plants and soils. The quantity of\nwater a plant can extract at tensions greater than this\nfigure appears to vary considerably with plant species,\nroot distribution, and soil characteristics. Some plants\nshow temporary plant moisture stress during hot\ndaytime periods and yet have adequate soil moisture.\nIn the laboratory, permanent wilting point is deter-\nmined at 15 atmospheres tension. Unless plant specific\ndata are known, any water remaining in a soil at\ngreater than 15 atmosphere tension is considered\nunavailable for plant use.\nMajor soil characteristics affecting the available water\ncapacity are texture, structure, bulk density, salinity,\nsodicity, mineralogy, soil chemistry, and organic\nmatter content. Of these, texture is the predominant\nfactor in mineral soils. Because of the particle configu-\nration in certain volcanic ash soils, these soils can\ncontain very high water content at field capacity\nlevels. This provides a high available water capacity\nvalue. Table 2–1 displays average available water\ncapacity based on soil texture. Table 2–2 provides\nadjustments to the available water capacity based on\npercent rock fragments. Generally, rock fragments\nreduce available water capacity.\nThe available water capacity value shown on the Soil\nInterpretation Record (SOI-5) accounts for the esti-\nmated volume of coarse fragments for the specific soil\nseries. However, any additional coarse fragments\nfound upon field checking must be accounted for.\nCoarse fragments of volcanic material, such as pumice\nand cinders, can contain water within the fragments\nthemselves, but this water may not be available for\nplant use because of the restricted root penetration\nand limited capillary water movement. A process to\nadjust the available water capacity based on additional\nfield information is displayed in table 2–3.\nTable 2–1 \tAvailable water capacity (AWC) by texture\nTexture \tTexture \tAWC \tAWC \tEst.\nsymbol \trange \trange \ttypical\nAWC\n(in/in) \t(in/ft) \t(in/ft)\nCOS \tCoarse sand \t.01 – .03 \t.1 – .4 \t.25\nS \tSand \t.01 – .03 \t.1 – .4 \t.25\nFS \tFine Sand \t.05 – .07 \t.6 – .8 \t.75\nVFS \tVery fine sand \t.05 – .07 \t.6 – .8 \t.75\nLCOS Loamy coarse sand \t.06 – .08 \t.7 – 1.0 \t.85\nLS \tLoamy sand \t.06 – .08 \t.7 – 1.0 \t.85\nLFS \tLoamy fine sand \t.09 – .11 \t1.1 – 1.3 \t1.25\nLVFS Loamy very fine sand .10 – .12 \t1.0 – 1.4 \t1.25\nCOSL Coarse sandy loam \t.10 – .12 \t1.2 – 1.4 \t1.3\nSL \tSandy loam \t.11 – .13 \t1.3 – 1.6 \t1.45\nFSL \tFine Sandy Loam \t.13 – .15 \t1.6 – 1.8 \t1.7\nVFSL Very fine sandy loam .15 – .17 \t1.8 – 2.0 \t1.9\nL \tLoam \t.16 – .18 \t1.9 – 2.2 \t2.0\nSIL \tSilt loam \t.19 – .21 \t2.3 – 2.5 \t2.4\nSI \tSilt \t.16 – .18 \t1.9 – 2.2 \t2.0\nSCL \tSandy clay loam \t.14 – .16 \t1.7 – 1.9 \t1.8\nCL \tClay loam \t.19 – .21 \t2.3 – 2.5 \t2.4\nSICL \tSilty clay loam \t.19 – .21 \t2.3 – 2.5 \t2.4\nSC \tSandy clay \t.15 – .17 \t1.8 – 2.0 \t1.9\nSIC \tSilty clay \t.15 – .17 \t1.8 – 2.0 \t1.9\nC \tClay \t.14 – .16 \t1.7 – 1.9 \t1.8",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nSoils\tChapter 2\n2–9\t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nDifferent soils hold water and release it differently.\nWhen soil-water content is high, very little effort is\nrequired by plant roots to extract moisture. As each\nunit of moisture is extracted, the next unit requires\nmore energy. This relationship is referred to as a soil\nmoisture release characteristic. Figure 2–1 shows\nwater release curves for typical sand, loam, and clay\nsoils. The tension in the plant root must be greater\nthan that in the soil at any water content to extract the\nsoil water. Typically with most field crops, crop yield\nis not affected if adequate soil water is available to the\nplant at less than 5 atmospheres for medium to fine\ntextured soils.\nAt soil-water tensions of more than about 5 atmo-\nspheres, plant yield or biomass is reduced in medium\nto fine textured soils.\nSalts in the soil-water solution decrease the amount of\nwater available for plant uptake. Maintaining a higher\nsoil-water content with more frequent irrigations\nrelieves the effect of salt on plant moisture stress.\nTable 2–4 displays AWC values adjusting for effect of\nsalinity versus texture. ECe is defined as the electrical\nconductivity of the soil-water extract corrected to\n77 °F (25 °C). Units are expressed in millimhos per\ncentimeter (mmho/cm) or deci Siemen per meter (dS/\nm). 1 mmho/cm = 1dS/m. See section 652.0202(i) for\nadditional information.\nTension levels for field capacity and wilting point in\ntable 2–4 are assumed.\nAWC is the major soil factor in irrigation scheduling.\nOnly a partial depletion of the AWC should be allowed.\nFor most field crops and loamy soils, 50 percent is\nallowed to be depleted to limit undue plant moisture\nstress. For most vegetables, 30 percent depletion is\ndesirable. As an example, data from figure 2–1 pro-\nvides the following approximate potential (tension)\nlevels for three general soil types:\nSoil \tTension at \tTension at \tDepletion at 5\n50% depletion \t30% depletion \tbars tension\nclay \t4.5 bars \t2.5 bars \t55%\nloam \t2 bars \t1.2 bars \t70%\nsand \t< 1 bars \t< 1 bars \t84%\nAllowed soil-water depletion is a management deci-\nsion based on the type of crop grown, stage of crop\ngrowth, total AWC of the soil profile, rainfall patterns,\nand the availability of the pumped or delivered water.\nIt is referred to as the Management Allowed Depletion,\nor MAD level. See Chapter 3, Crops, for MAD levels for\noptimum yield and quality of most crops. The conven-\ntional concepts of total soil volume AWC and MAD do\nnot apply to microirrigation where root volumes and\nwetted volumes are restricted.\nNEH, Section 15, Chapter 1, Soil-Plant-Water Relation-\nships provides an excellent and thorough description\nof soil-water relationships; therefore, the information\nincluded here is quite limited.\nFigure 2–1 \tTypical water release curves for sand, loam,\nand clay\n100\n30% level\n50% level\nField capacity\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n0 \t2 \t4 \t6 \t8 \t10 \t12 \t14 \t16\t5\nPermanent wilting point - 15 bars\nSoil water potential (-bars)\nAvailable water (%)\nSand\nClay\nLoam\nTexture\nCourse\nMedium & fine\n@ field capacity\n0.1\n0.33\n@ Perm. wilting point\n15.0\n15.0\nTension level (atmospheres or bars)",

It defines the fineness or coarse-\nness of a soil. Particle sizes larger than 2 mm are\nclassed as rock or coarse fragments and are not used\nto define texture. Table 2–5 shows terms and symbols\nused in describing soil textures.\nFine textured soils generally hold more water than\ncoarse textured soils. Medium textured soils actually\nhave more available water for plant use than some\nclay soils. Water in clay soils can be held at a greater\ntension that reduces its availability to plants.\nFigure 1–2, of NEH, Part 623, Chapter 1, Soil-Plant-\nWater Relationship, displays what is commonly re-\nferred to as the USDA textural triangle. It describes\nthe proportions of sand, silt, and clay in the basic\ntextural classes. Texture determines the amount of\nsurface area on soil particles within the soil mass. Clay\nand humus both exist in colloidal state and have an\nextremely large surface area per unit weight. They\ncarry surface electrical charges to which ions and\nwater are attracted.\nThe USDA Soils Manual includes the following general\ndefinitions of soil textural classes in terms of field\nexperience. These definitions are also specifically\nused in estimating soil-water content by the feel and\nappearance method. See Chapter 9, Irrigation Water\nManagement and Chapter 15, Irrigation Water Manage-\nment Plan.\nSand—Sand is loose and single-grained. The indi-\nvidual grains can be readily seen and felt. Squeezed in\nthe hand when dry, sand falls apart when pressure is\nreleased. Squeezed when moist, it forms a cast, but\ncrumbles when touched.\nSandy loam—A sandy loam is soil containing a high\npercentage of sand, but having enough silt and clay to\nmake it somewhat coherent. The individual sand\ngrains can be readily seen and felt. Squeezed when\ndry, a sandy loam forms a cast that falls apart readily.\nIf squeezed when moist, a cast can be formed that\nbears careful handling without breaking.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nSoils\n2–12 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nChapter 2\nLoam—A loam is soil having a relatively even mix-\nture of different grades of sand, silt, and clay. It is\nfriable with a somewhat gritty feel, but is fairly\nsmooth and slightly plastic. Squeezed when dry, it\nforms a cast that bears careful handling, and the cast\nformed by squeezing the moist soil can be handled\nfreely without breaking.\nSilt loam—A silt loam is soil having a moderate\namount of fine sand with a small amount of clay. Over\nhalf of the particles are silt size particles. When dry, a\nsilt loam appears cloddy, but the lumps can be readily\nbroken. When pulverized, it feels soft and floury. When\nwet, the soil runs together readily and puddles. Either\ndry or moist, silt loam forms a cast that can be handled\nfreely without breaking. When moist and squeezed\nbetween thumb and finger, it does not ribbon, but has\na broken appearance.\nClay loam—A clay loam is moderately fine-textured\nsoil that generally breaks into clods or lumps that are\nhard when dry. When the moist soil is pinched be-\ntween the thumb and finger, it forms a thin ribbon that\nbreaks readily, barely sustaining its own weight. The\nmoist soil is plastic and forms a cast that bears much\nhandling. When kneaded in the hand, clay loam does\nnot crumble readily, but works into a heavy compact\nmass.\nClay—A clay is fine-textured soil that usually forms\nvery hard lumps or clods when dry and is very sticky\nand plastic when wet. When moist soil is pinched\nbetween thumb and finger, it forms a long flexible\nribbon. Some clays that are very high in colloids are\nfriable and lack plasticity at all moisture levels.\nOrganic—Organic soils vary in organic matter con-\ntent from 20 to 95 percent. They generally are classi-\nfied on the degree of decomposition of the organic\ndeposits. The terms muck, peat, and mucky peat are\ncommonly used. Muck is well-decomposed organic\nmaterial. Peat is raw, undecomposed, very fibrous\norganic material in which the original fibers constitute\nall the material.\n(4) Soil structure\nSoil structure is the arrangement and organization of\nsoil particles into natural units of aggregation. These\nunits are separated from one another by weakness\nplanes that persist through cycles of wetting and\ndrying and cycles of freezing and thawing. Structure\ninfluences air and water movement, root development,\nand nutrient supply.\nStructure type refers to the particular kind of grouping\nthat predominates in a soil horizon. Single-grained and\nmassive soils are structureless. In single-grained soils,\nsuch as loose sand, water percolates rapidly. Water\nmoves very slowly through most clay soils. A more\nfavorable water relationship occurs in soils that have\nprismatic, blocky and granular structure. Platy struc-\nture in fine and medium soils impedes the downward\nmovement of water. See figure 2–2. Structure can be\nimproved with cultural practices, such as conservation\ntillage, improving internal drainage, liming or adding\nsulfur to soil, using grasses in crop rotation, incorpo-\nrating crop residue, and adding organic material or soil\namendments. Structure can be destroyed by heavy\ntillage equipment or excess operations.\nTexture, root activity, percent clay, percent organic\nmatter, microbial activity, and the freeze-thaw cycle all\nplay a part in aggregate formation and stability. Some\naggregates are quite stable upon wetting, and others\ndisperse readily. Soil aggregation helps maintain\nstability when wet, resist dispersion caused by the\nimpact from sprinkler droplets, maintain soil intake\nrate, and resist surface water and wind erosion. Irriga-\ntion water containing sodium can cause dispersing of\nsoil aggregates. See discussion of SAR in Section\n652.0202(i). Clay mineralogy has a major influence on\nsoil aggregation and shrink-swell characteristics. See\nNEH, part 623, chapter 1, for additional discussion.",

Units\nare expressed as the weight at oven-dry and volume at\nfield capacity water content, expressed as grams per\ncubic centimeter (g/cc) or pounds per cubic foot\n(lb/ft3). Soil is composed of soil particles, organic\nmatter, water, and air.\n(6) Soil pore space\nBulk density is used to convert water measurements\nfrom a weight basis to a volume basis that can be used\nfor irrigation related calculations. Many tools are avail-\nable to measure bulk density in the field as well as in the\nlaboratory. They are described in Chapter 9, Irrigation\nWater Management. Exhibit 2–2 displays the process to\ndetermine the total volume of water held in a soil.\nPore space allows the movement of water, air, and\nroots. Dense soils have low available water capacity\nbecause of decreased pore space. Density can make\nAWC differences of –50 percent to +30 percent com-\npared to average densities. Sandy soils generally have\nbulk densities greater than clayey soils. Sandy soils\nhave less total pore space than silt and clay soils.\nGravitational water flows through sandy soils much\nfaster because the pores are much larger. Clayey soils\nhold more water than sandy soils because clay soils\nhave a larger volume of small, flat-shaped pore spaces\nthat hold more capillary water. Clay soil particles are\nflattened or platelike in shape, thus, soil-water tension\nis also higher for a given volume of water. When the\npercent clay in a soil increases over about 40 percent,\nAWC is reduced even though total soil-water content\nmay be greater. Permeability and drainability of soil\nare directly related to the volume and size and shape\nof pore space.\nUniform plant root development and water movement\nin soil occur when soil profile bulk density is uniform,\na condition that seldom exists in the field. Generally,\nsoil compaction occurs in all soils where tillage imple-\nments and wheel traffic are used. Compaction de-\ncreases pore space, decreasing root development,\noxygen content, and water movement and availability.\nOther factors affecting soil bulk density include freeze/\nthaw process, plant root growth and decay, worm-\nholes, and organic matter.\nExhibit 2–2 \tProcess to determine total volume of water held in a soil\nLet: Db \t= bulk density \tSchematic:\nDp \t= particle density (specific gravity)\nW s \t= weight of soil solids (oven dry)\nW w \t= weight of soil water\nVs \t= volume of solids\nVp \t= volume of pores (both air & water)\nVw \t= volume of water\nVs + V p = total soil volume\nD W\nV \tV\n\tb s\ns \tp\n= + D W\nV\n\tp s\ns\n= \tD \tV \tD \tV \tV\tb \ts \tb \ts \tp\t× \t= \t+\t( \t)\nV\nV \tV\nD\nD\ns\ns \tp\nb\np\t+ = \t% Solids V\nV \tV\nD\nD\ns\ns \tp\nb\np\n= + × \t= \t×\t100 \t100\n% pore space = \t− \t×\n\n\n\n\n\n\t100 \t100\nD\nD\nb\np\n% water W\nW\nw\ns\n= \t× 100\n% volume of water = + × \t= \t× \t×\nV\nV \tV\nW\nW D\tw\ns \tp\nw\ns\nb\t100 \t100\nVolume of water (in/ft) volume of water 12 in/ft\n= ×\t%\n100\nAir\nWater\nSolids\nW\nWw\nWs\nVa\nVw\nVs\nV\nVp",

NEH, Part\n623, Chapter 1, Soil-Plant-Water Relationship provides\ndetailed discussion of the water infiltration process.\nInfiltration rates change during the time water is\napplied, typically becoming slower with elapsed time.\nThey typically decrease as the irrigation season\nprogresses because of cultivation and harvest equip-\nment. This is especially true if operations are done at\nhigher soil-water content levels. Preferential flow\npaths, such as cracks and wormholes, influence infil-\ntration and permeability. Infiltration rates are also\naffected by water quality; for example, suspended\nsediment, temperature, sodicity, and SAR, affect\nwater surface tension.\nSoil intake characteristics affect design, operation, and\nmanagement of surface irrigation systems.\n(1) Surface irrigation systems\nThe water infiltration capability of a soil is referred to\nas soil intake characteristic. For surface irrigation\nsystems, intake characteristic is expressed by the\nequation:\nF \taT \tc\to\nb\n= \t+\nwhere:\nF = Cumulative intake for an opportunity time\nperiod (inches)\na = Intercept along the cumulative intake axis\nTo = Opportunity time (minutes)\nb = Slope of cumulative intake vs. time curve\nc = Constant (commonly 0.275)\n(See NEH, Part 623, Chapter 4, Border Irrigation, and\nChapter 5, Furrow Irrigation.)\nSoil intake characteristics directly influence length of\nrun, required inflow rate, and time of set that provide a\nuniform and efficient irrigation without excessive deep\npercolation and runoff. Table 2–6 displays estimated\nsoil infiltration characteristics for border, furrow and\nfixed set or periodic move sprinkler irrigation systems\nbased on surface soil texture.\nFor surface systems, water is considered ponded\nwhere it is 2 to 8 inches deep. Water infiltration for\nborders and basins is vertically downward. For fur-\nrows, infiltration is vertically downward, horizontal,\nand upward into furrow ridges. More field testing has\nbeen done for borders than for furrows; therefore,\nintake estimates for borders are more readily avail-\nable. These intake characteristics can be converted for\nuse with furrows, but the intake process differences\nmust be accounted for in the conversion.\nFigure 2–3 displays intake groupings used for design-\ning border and basin and contour surface irrigation\nsystems. Figure 2–4 displays intake groupings used for\ndesigning furrow irrigation systems. Furrow intake\ncharacteristics differ from border and basin intake\ncharacteristics because of the direction of water\nmovement near the soil surface and the percent of soil\nsurface covered by water.\nTable 2–6 \tSoil intake ranges by surface texture 1/\nSoil \t- - - - - - - - - - - Intake characteristics - - - - - - - - - - - -\ntexture \tSprinkle \tFurrow \tBorder & basin\nC, SIC \t.1 – .2 \t.1 – .5 \t.1 – .3\nSC, SICL \t.1 – .4 \t.2 – .8 \t.25 – .75\nCL, SCL \t.1 – .5 \t.2 – 1.0 \t.3 – 1.0\nSIL, L \t.5 – .7 \t.3 – 1.2 \t.5 – 1.5\nVFSL, FSL \t.3 – 1.0 \t.4 – 1.9 \t1.0 – 3.0\nSL, LVFS \t.3 – 1.25 \t.5 – 2.4 \t1.5 – 4.0\nLFS, LS \t.4 – 1.5 \t.6 – 3.0 \t2.0 – 4.0\nFS, S \t.5 + \t1.0 + \t3.0 +\nCS \t1.0 + \t4.0 + \t4.0 +\n1/ These are estimates based on soil texture.

This condition is most likely to\noccur on soils that are\n• sodic,\n• poorly graded,\n• bare,\n• contain low organic matter,\n• have little or no surface residue, and\n• have limited vegetation canopy.\nTable 2–7 displays the estimated maximum net appli-\ncation amounts and rates for center pivot systems. The\ntable displays the sprinkler intake group and the\namount of soil surface storage needed to apply an\nallowable irrigation amount. All systems are consid-\nered to be 1,320 feet in length. The following systems\nare compared in the table:\n• High pressure impact heads with a peak rate of\n1.0 in/hr.\n• Medium pressure impact heads with a peak\nrate of 1.5 in/hr.\n• Low pressure impact heads with a peak rate of\n2.5 in/hr.\n• Low pressure spray, two direction system with\npeak rate of 3.5 in/hr.\n• Low pressure spray, one direction system with\npeak rate of 6.0 in/hr.\nValues for various slopes for the maximum allowable\nnet application amount without additional storage\ncreated by special practices, are:\nField \tApproximate soil\nslope \tsurface storage\n(%) \t(in)\n0 - 1 \t0.5\n1 - 3 \t0.3\n3 - 5 \t0.1\n> 5 \t0.0\nThe infiltration process is different when using sprin-\nkler and border (or furrow) irrigation. With border\nirrigation, a small head or depth of water (pressure) is\nplaced on the soil surface. With sprinkler and microir-\nrigation, the soil surface remains mostly unsaturated.\nThe association with sprinkle application rate and\nborder intake family is through surface texture.\n(2) Sprinkler irrigation systems\nFor sprinkle irrigation, infiltration is referred to as\neither an intake rate or maximum application rate,\nexpressed as inches per hour (in/hr). Application rates\nand timing vary according to type of sprinkler or spray\nhead. With impact heads, water on the ground surface\nis at a single point only with each head rotation. With\nspray heads, water is on the ground surface continu-\nously, but at very shallow depth. Soil surface storage is\nimportant where water is applied in short time peri-\nods; i.e., the outer end of low pressure center pivot\nlaterals.\nCaution should be used when comparing average\nsprinkler application rates with published soil infiltra-\ntion values. Some of the problems include:\n• Low angle nozzles apply proportionally more\nwater in the area nearest the nozzle.\n• Peak instantaneous application rates under\ncontinuously self-moving sprinkler laterals can\nbe very high. However, when expressed as an\naverage hourly rate over the total irrigated\narea, these rates may appear quite low. For\nexample: A 1-inch irrigation application being\nmade at the outer end of a quarter mile long\nLow Pressure In Canopy center pivot lateral\ncan apply water at instantaneous rates exceed-\ning 50 inches per hour for 2 to 10 minutes, but\nthe average hourly rate is considerably less. In\nmedium and fine textured soils, the amount\ninfiltrated during the application period can be\nvery low.\nAdequate soil surface storage is required to limit\ntranslocation of water within the field and perhaps\nfield runoff during the infiltration process. Sprinkler\nsystems should be designed with application rates that\ndo not exceed the soil intake rate unless soil surface\nstorage or other considerations are made.\nWater droplet impact on a bare soil surface from\nsprinkler systems can cause dispersion of some soils.\nThe bigger the droplets, the more the potential disper-\nsion and microcompaction of soil particles. Bigger\ndroplets are generally a result of inadequate operating\npressure or long distances from the nozzle to the point\nof impact. This action forms a dense and less perme-\nable thin surface layer that can reduce the infiltration",

These estimates are\nbased on averages from many field measurements.\nTables 2–12 and 2–13 can be used to estimate effective\nsurface storage with cloddy bare ground and residue\nonly on level or nearly level slopes.\n(d) Organic matter\nSoil organic matter is the organic fraction of the soil. It\nincludes plant and animal residue at various stages of\ndecomposition and cells and tissues of soil organisms.\nOrganic matter directly influences soil structure, soil\ncondition, soil bulk density, water infiltration, plant\ngrowth and root development, permeability, available\nwater capacity, biological activity, oxygen availability,\nnutrient availability, and farmability, as well as many\nother factors that make the soil a healthy natural\nresource for plant growth. Organic matter has a high\ncation adsorption capacity, and its decomposition\nreleases nitrogen, phosphorous, and sulfur. Site specific\norganic matter values should always be used for plan-\nning and managing irrigation systems. Published values\noften are from sites that were managed quite differently.\n(e) Soil depth\nDepth is the dimension from the soil surface to bed-\nrock, hardpan, water table; to a specified soil depth; or\nto a root growth restrictive layer. The deeper the soil\nand plant roots, the more soil-water storage is avail-\nable for plant use. Crop rooting depth and the resulting\ntotal AWC control the length of time plants can go\nbetween irrigations or effective rainfall events before\nreaching moisture stress. Equipment compaction\nlayers or natural occurring impervious layers restrict\nthe downward movement of water and root penetra-\ntion. Providing artificial drainage of poorly drained\nsoils increases soil depth for potential root develop-\nment. Adequate soil drainage must be present for\nsustained growth of most plants.\nAn abrupt change in soil texture with depth can re-\nstrict downward water movement. For example, a\ncoarse sand underlying a medium or fine textured soil\nrequires saturation at the interface before substantial\nwater will move into the coarser soil below. When a\ncoarse textured soil abruptly changes to a medium or\nfine textured soil with depth, a temporary perched\nwater table develops above the slower permeable soil.\nStratified soils or shallow soils over hardpans or\nbedrock can also hold excess gravitational water at\nthe interface. The excess water can move upward\nbecause of the increased soil particle surface tension\n(suction) as the soil water in the upper profile is used\nby plants. Thus, an otherwise shallow soil with low\ntotal AWC can have characteristics of a deeper soil.\nTable 2–11 \tEstimated effective basin surface storage\nTillage operation \tEffective storage depth (in)\nBasin tillage \t1.2\nReservoir (dammer-diker) \t0.75\nSubsoiler \t0.16\nField cultivator \t0.12",

For example, a 1.5 percent slope is a 1.5-foot rise\nor fall in 100 feet horizontal distance. In planning\nirrigation systems, slope is important in determining\nthe type of irrigation system best suited to the site. It is\nalso important in determining optimum and maximum\napplication rates (or streamflow rates) for applying\nwater.\nErosion potential from excessive surface irrigation\nflows increases as the slope and slope length increase.\nPotential runoff from sprinkler systems also increases\nas the slope increases, thus raising the opportunity for\nerosion to occur.\n(g) Water tables\nWater tables can be a barrier for root development\nbecause of restricted oxygen availability. Through\nplanned water table control and management, shallow\nground water can supply all or part of the seasonal\ncrop water needs. The water must be high quality, salt\nfree, and held at or near a constant elevation. The\nwater table level should be controlled to provide water\naccording to crop needs. Figure 2–6 displays approxi-\nmate water table contribution, based on soil texture\nand depth to water table. Some stratified soils respond\npoorly to water table control because of the restric-\ntions to water movement. The NRCS computer model\nDRAINMOD can be used to analyze water tables and\nsubsurface water movement. Documentation for the\nprogram includes definitions of factors.\n(h) Soil erodibility\nThe erodibility of a soil should be considered in the\nplanning stage of any irrigation system. The rate and\nmethod at which water is applied should be controlled\nso that it will not cause excessive runoff and erosion.\nFactors influencing soil erosion, such as stream size\nfor surface systems, surface storage because of resi-\ndue, microbasins, and vegetative cover, are not related\nto soil properties. Table 2–14 shows soil erodibility\nhazard for surface irrigation. It is based on soil struc-\nture, permeability, percent organic matter, percent silt\nand very fine sand, and field slope. Three classes\nindicate degree of erosion hazard on irrigated crop-\nland for planning surface irrigation.

Exposure of the rock surface to water, oxygen,\norganic matter, and carbon dioxide brings about\nchemical alterations on the rock material. Oxidation,\nreduction, hydration, hydrolysis, and carbonation\ncontribute to rock disintegration and creation of new\nchemical compounds and solutions. The chemical and\nmineralogical composition of the soil vary with re-\nspect to depth or horizon. Weathering intensity de-\ncreases with depth from the surface. The longer the\nweathering has proceeded, the thicker the weathered\nlayer and the greater the difference from the original\nmaterial. In mineral soils, organic matter content\ngenerally decreases with depth.\nThe colloidal fraction (diameter less than 0.001 mm) of\nthe soil plays an important part in the chemistry of the\nsoil. Microbiological activity is greatest near the sur-\nface where oxygen, organic matter content, and tem-\nperature are the highest.\nCation Exchange Capacity (CEC) is the total amount\nof cations held in a soil in such a way that they can be\nremoved by exchanging with another cation in the\nnatural soil solution, expressed in milliequivalents per\n100 grams of oven-dry soil (meq/100 gm). The cation\nexchange capacity is a measure of the ability of a soil\nto retain cations, some of which are plant nutrients. It\nis affected primarily by the kind and amount of clay\nand organic matter. Soils that have low CEC hold\nfewer cations and may require more frequent applica-\ntions of fertilizers than soils with high CEC. See NASIS\nMUR data base or SCS-SOI-5 for CEC estimates for\nspecific soil series.\n(j) Saline and sodic soil effects\nSalt affected soils are generally classified as follows,\nusing electrical conductivity of the soil-water extract,\nEC e, as the basis:\nSalinity \tEC e\nVery Slight \t0 – 4 dS/m\nSlight \t4 – 8 dS/m\nModerate \t8 – 16 dS/m\nStrong \t> 16 dS/m\nEC e is the electrical conductivity of soil-water extract\ncorrected to 77 °F (25 °C), usually expressed in units\nof mmho per centimeter or deci-Siemens per meter.\n1 mmho/cm = 1 dS/m\nAs water is evaporated from the soil surface or used\nby plants, salts and sodic ions within the soil-water\nsolution are left behind either on the ground surface or\nwithin the soil profile. Accumulated saline salts can be\nreduced by leaching with excess water through the\nsoil profile. This may need to be done regularly to\nmaintain a proper salt balance for desirable plant\ngrowth. Figure 2–7 displays the effect of soil salinity\non AWC on a clay loam soil.\nA detailed description of soil and water salinity and\nsodicity is given in the American Society of Civil\nEngineers Report No. 71, Agricultural Salinity Assess-\nment and Management (ASCE 1990), and in the Na-\ntional Engineering Handbook, Part 623, Chapter 2,\nIrrigation Water Requirements (USDA 1993).\nSodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR), is the standard mea-\nsure of the sodicity of a soil or quality of the irrigation\nwater. It replaces the previously used exchangeable\nsodium percentage (ESP).",

Crop response to irrigation\nvaries with soils, fertility, type of plants, stage of\ngrowth, and local climate. Where crop stress caused\nby moisture shortage is prevented by proper and\ntimely irrigation, other factors can become inhibitors\nto desirable yield and quality.\nKnowledge of how plants respond to, and use, soil\nwater throughout their growing season is essential to\nsuccessfully design and manage an irrigation system.\nContinuous plant uptake of soil nutrients has a poten-\ntial for improving ground water quality. Profitable crop\nproduction is generally the objective of agriculture.\nWith proper management, soils (or water) affected by\nsalinity or sodicity can sustain plant growth in perpe-\ntuity. Irrigation provides the insurance for high quality\nand desirable quantity crops at reduced risk in semi-\narid, subhumid, and humid areas. It is a necessity in\narid regions. The effect of irrigation both onsite and\noffsite on soil, water, air, plant, and animal resources\nalong with human considerations needs to be consid-\nered.\n(a) Soil condition\nFor desirable crop growth, good soil condition is key\nto optimum soil aeration, water infiltration, permeabil-\nity, and uniform root development. It also helps reduce\nrunoff and potential soil erosion. Good soil condition\ncan be maintained or improved by eliminating excess\ntillage operations, avoiding field operations while soil-\nwater content is high, using organic material or crop\nresidue, and using grass and legumes in rotation. To\nreduce opportunity of soil compaction on irrigated\npastures, livestock should be excluded during and\nafter irrigation until adequate soil surface dry-out\noccurs.\n(b) Nutrient management\nA healthy plant uses water more efficiently than a\nplant that lacks nutrients and trace elements. Total\nwater use by a healthy plant is greater than that for a\nplant deprived of nutrients. However, the yield per unit\nof water is much greater for healthy plants.\nSoil fertility is maintained with proper nutrient man-\nagement by maintaining proper soil reaction (pH level)\nand by using an appropriate cropping system. Liming\nmay be needed on acid soil. On saline soils, leaching of\nexcess salts is generally needed. On sodic soils, both\nsoil amendments and leaching may be needed. Soil\ntests, field observations, planned yield and quality, and\nfield experience help determine the type and amount\nof fertilizers and other elements to use. Using excess\nfertilizer or poor application timing can result in\nmovement of chemicals below the root zone into the\nground water or off the field.\n(c) Soil, water, pest, nutrient, and\ncrop residue management\nOptimum production requires the operator to control\nweeds and insects, use high quality seed of adapted\nvarieties, apply fertilizer according to plant needs, and\npractice good soil and water management during all\nparts of the growing season. Crops grown should be\nselected to fit the soil, water, climate, irrigation sys-\ntem, farm equipment, and market availability. Plant\npopulation can generally be increased when practicing\ngood soil, water, pesticide, nutrient, and crop residue\nmanagement.",

A practical definition for\nwater use efficiency is the amount of yield per unit of\narea per unit of water, e.g., 6 bushels of wheat per acre\nper acre-inch of applied water. Such yield water use\ncomparison units can provide a basis for comparison\nwhen improvements are made.\nMaintaining soil water within a desirable depletion\nrange (preferably less than 5 bars tension) generally\nprovides the expected yield and quality. The effect on\nyield and quality depends on how severe and during\nwhich period of crop growth water deficit occurs.\nApplying excess irrigation water over and above that\nnecessary to grow a successful crop will not increase\nyields and generally reduces yields.\nOther factors, such as the lack of available nutrients,\ntrace elements, and uncontrolled pest activity, may\nlimit crop yield. Excess irrigation water can leach\nessential plant nutrients and some pesticides and their\nmetabolites below the root zone. This is especially\ntrue with nitrates, which are quite mobile in water.\nExcess irrigation water percolating below the root\nzone can pollute ground water.\n(b) Critical growth periods\nPlants must have ample moisture throughout the\ngrowing season for optimum production and the most\nefficient use of water. This is most important during\ncritical periods of growth and development. Most\ncrops are sensitive to water stress during one or more\ncritical growth periods in their growing season. Mois-\nture stress during a critical period can cause an irre-\nversible loss of yield or product quality. Critical peri-\nods must be considered with caution because they\ndepend on plant specie as well as variety. Some crops\ncan be moderately stressed during noncritical periods\nwith no adverse effect on yields. Other plants require\nmild stress to set and develop fruit for optimum har-\nvest time (weather or market).\nThe need for an irrigation should be determined by an\nonsite examination of the soil for water content or by\nany irrigation scheduling method for which basic data\nhave been established. Using only plant appearance as\nthe moisture deficit symptom can lead to misinterpre-\ntation, which generally results in reduction of yield\nand product quality. When the plant appears to be dry,\nit may already be in a moisture stress condition. Some\nplants temporarily wilt to conserve moisture during\notherwise high evapotranspiration periods of the day.\nDry appearance may also be caused by other problems\n(lack of nutrients, insect activity, disease, lack of\nessential trace elements). Critical water periods for\nmost crops and other irrigation considerations are\ndisplayed in table 3–1. Irrigation scheduling techniques\nare described in more detail in Chapter 9, Irrigation\nWater Management.",

The\namount of water a soil can hold available for plant use\nis determined by its physical properties. It also deter-\nmines the frequency of irrigation and the capacity of\nthe irrigation system needed to ensure continuous\ncrop growth and development.\nThe type of root system a plant has is fixed by genetic\nfactors. Some plants have tap roots that penetrate\ndeeply into the soil, while others develop many shal-\nlow lateral roots. The depth of the soil reservoir that\nholds water available to a plant is determined by that\nplant’s rooting characteristics and soil characteristics\nincluding compaction layers and water management.\nThe distribution of the plant roots determines its\nmoisture extraction pattern. Figure 3–1 shows typical\nroot distribution for several field and vegetable crops.\nTypical rooting depths for various crops grown on a\ndeep, well drained soil with good water and soil man-\nagement are listed in table 3–4.\nFor annual crops, rooting depths vary by stage of\ngrowth and should be considered in determining the\namount of water to be replaced each irrigation. All\nplants have very shallow roots early in their develop-\nment period; therefore, only light and frequent irriga-\ntions are needed. Because roots will not grow into a\ndry soil, soil moisture outside the actual root develop-\nment area is needed for the plant to develop a full root\nsystem in the soil profile. Excess moisture in this area\nwill also limit root development.\nFor most plants, the concentration of moisture absorb-\ning roots is greatest in the upper part of the root zone\n(usually in the top quarter). Extraction is most rapid in\nthe zone of greatest root concentration and where the\nmost favorable conditions of aeration, biological\nactivity, temperature, and nutrient availability occur.\nWater also evaporates from the upper few inches of\nthe soil; therefore, water is diminished most rapidly\nfrom the upper part of the soil. This creates a high soil-\nwater potential gradient.\nTable 3–4 \tDepths to which the roots of mature crops\nwill extract available soil water from a deep,\nuniform, well drained soil under average\nunrestricted conditions (depths shown are\nfor 80% of the roots)\nCrop \tDepth \tCrop \tDepth\n(ft) \t(ft)\nAlfalfa \t5 \tPeas \t2 - 3\nAsparagus \t5 \tPeppers \t1 - 2\nBananas \t5 \tPotatoes, Irish \t2 - 3\nBeans, dry \t2 - 3 \tPotatoes, sweet \t2 - 3\nBeans, green \t2 - 3 \tPumpkins \t3 - 4\nBeets, table \t2 - 3 \tRadishes \t1\nBroccoli \t2 \tSafflower \t4\nBerries, blue \t4 - 5 \tSorghum \t4\nBerries, cane \t4 - 5 \tSpinach \t1 - 2\nBrussel sprouts \t2 \tSquash \t3 - 4\nCabbage \t2 \tStrawberries \t1 - 2\nCantaloupes \t3 \tSudan grass \t3 - 4\nCarrots \t2 \tSugar beets \t4 - 5\nCauliflower \t2 \tSugarcane \t4 - 5\nCelery \t1 - 2 \tSunflower \t4 - 5\nChard \t1 - 2 \tTobacco \t3 - 4\nClover, Ladino \t2 - 3 \tTomato \t3\nCranberries \t1 \tTurnips \t2 - 3\nCorn, sweet \t2 - 3 \tWatermelon \t3 - 4\nCorn, grain \t3 - 4 \tWheat \t4\nCorn seed \t3 - 4\nCorn, silage \t3 - 4\nCotton \t4 - 5 \tTrees\nCucumber \t1 - 2 \tFruit \t4 - 5\nEggplant \t2 \tCitrus \t3 - 4\nGarlic \t1 - 2 \tNut \t4 - 5\nGrains & flax \t3 - 4\nGrapes \t5 \tShrubs & misc. trees\nGrass pasture/hay \t2 - 4 \tfor windbreaks\nGrass seed \t3 - 4 \t< 10 ft tall \t2 – 3+\nLettuce \t1 - 2 \t10 – 25 ft tall \t3 – 4+\nMelons \t2 - 3 \t> 25 ft tall \t5+\nMilo \t2 - 4\nMustard \t2 \tOther\nOnions \t1 - 2 \tTurf (sod & lawn) 1 - 2\nParsnips \t2 - 3 \tNursery stock \t1 - 3\nPeanuts \t2 - 3 \tNursery stock \tpots",

Figure 3–2 shows\nthe typical water extraction pattern in a uniform soil.\nAbout 70 percent of available soil water comes from\nthe upper half of a uniform soil profile.

Variations and\ninclusions are in most soil map units, thus uniformity\nshould not be assumed. Field investigation is required\nto confirm or determine onsite soil characteristics\nincluding surface texture, depth, slope, and potential\nand actual plant root zone depths.\nSoil texture, structure, and condition help determine\nthe available supply of water in the soil for plant use\nand root development.

Very thin tillage\npans can restrict root development in an otherwise\nhomogenous soil. Never assume a plant root zone.\nObserve root development of present or former crops.\nNumerous soil factors may limit the plant’s genetic\ncapabilities for root development. The most important\nfactors are:\n• soil density and pore size or configuration,\n• depth to restrictive layers and tillage pans,\n• soil-water status,\n• soil condition,\n• soil aeration,\n• organic matter,\n• nutrient availability,\n• textural or structural stratification,\n• water table,\n• salt concentrations, and\n• soil-borne organisms that damage or destroy\nplant roots.\nRoot penetration can be extremely limited into dry\nsoil, a water table, bedrock, high salt concentration\nzones, equipment and tillage compaction layers, dense\nfine texture soils, and hardpans. When root develop-\nment is restricted, it reduces plant available soil-water\nstorage and greatly alters irrigation practices neces-\nsary for the desired crop production and water con-\nservation.\nRoot penetration is seriously affected by high soil\ndensities that can result from tillage and farm equip-\nment. Severe compacted layers can result from heavy\nfarm equipment, tillage during higher soil moisture\nlevel periods, and from the total number of operations\nduring the crop growing season. In many medium to\nfine textured soils, a compacted layer at a uniform\ntillage depth causes roots to be confined to the upper 6\nto 10 inches. Roots seek the path of least resistance,\nthus do not penetrate a compacted dense layer except\nthrough cracks. Every tillage operation causes some\ncompaction. Even very thin tillage pans restrict root\ndevelopment and can confine roots to a shallow depth,\nthereby limiting the depth for water extraction. This is\nprobably most common with row crops where many\nfield operations occur and with hayland when soils are\nat high moisture levels during harvest.",

However, unless the cause of\ncompaction (typically tillage equipment itself), the\nnumber of operations, and the method and timing of\nthe equipment’s use are changed, compaction layers\nwill again develop.

Small\napertures (stomata) on the upper and lower surfaces\nof the leaves allow for the intake of carbon dioxide\nrequired for photosynthesis and plant growth. Water\nvapor is lost to the atmosphere from the plant leaves\nby a process called transpiration. Direct water evapo-\nration also occurs from the plant leaves and from the\nsoil surface. The total water used by the specific crop,\nwhich includes direct evaporation from plant leaves\nand the soil surface and transpiration, is called crop\nevapotranspiration (ET c). Processes to determine\nlocal crop evapotranspiration are described in NEH,\nPart 623, Chapter 2, Irrigation Water Requirements,\nand in Chapter 4, Water Requirements, of this guide.\n(b) Irrigation frequency\nHow much and how often irrigation water must be\napplied depends on the soil AWC in the actual plant\nroot zone, the crop grown and stage of growth, the\nrate of evapotranspiration of the crop, the planned soil\nManagement Allowable Depletion (MAD) level, and\neffective rainfall. More simply put; it depends on the\ncrop, soil, and climate.\nNever assume a plant root zone for management\npurposes. Check actual root development pattern and\ndepth. See section 652.0301(d).\nOnce a MAD is selected, determining when to irrigate\nsimply requires estimation or measurement of when\nthe soil moisture reaches that level. Coarse textured\nand shallow soils must be irrigated more frequently\nthan fine textured deep soils because fine textured\ndeep soils store more available water. The moisture\nuse rate varies with the crop and soil. It increases as\nthe crop area canopy increases, as humidity decreases\nand as the days become longer and warmer.\nFrequency can be estimated by dividing the MAD by\nthe estimated or measured evapotranspiration of the\ncrop as follows:\nIrrigation frequency (days) MAD inches\nCrop ET rate (in/day)\n= ( \t)\nA much higher quality product is produced if the MAD\nlevel is kept less than 35 percent in some crops, such\nas potatoes, pecans, vegetables, and melons. This is\nalso true for mint.\nSeveral methods are available for irrigation scheduling\n(determining when to irrigate and how much to apply).\nThey are described in Chapter 9, Irrigation Water\nManagement.\n(c) Net irrigation requirement\nThe net amount of water to be replaced at each irriga-\ntion is the amount the soil can hold between field\ncapacity and the moisture level selected when irriga-\ntion is needed (MAD). Maintaining the same soil\nmoisture level throughout the growing season is not\npractical and probably not desirable. Ideally, an irriga-\ntion is started just before the selected MAD level is\nreached or when the soil will hold the irrigation appli-\ncation plus expected rainfall. The net amount of water\nrequired depends on soil AWC in the plant root zone\nand the ability of a particular crop to tolerate moisture\nstress. If the MAD level selected is 40 percent of AWC\nin the root zone (Soil-water Deficit = 40%), it is neces-\nsary to add that amount of water to bring the root zone\nup to field capacity. For example if the total soil AWC\nin the root zone is 8 inches and MAD = 40%:\nNet irrigation = \t×\n=\n40 \t8\n3 2\n%\n.\nin\nin\nIn semihumid and humid areas, good water managers\ndo not bring the soil to field capacity with each irriga-\ntion, but leave room for storage of expected rainfall.\nWhen rainfall does not occur, the irrigation frequency\nmust be shortened to keep the soil moisture within the\nMAD limit. It is a management decision to let MAD\nexceed the ability of an irrigation system to apply\nwater. For example, if a center pivot sprinkler system\napplies a net of 1 inch per cycle, let MAD be equal to 1\ninch plus expected rainfall. MAD for a surface irriga-\ntion system will be typically greater as heavier applica-\ntions are required for best uniformity across the field.",

No irrigation\nsystem that fully meets the season crop evapotranspi-\nration needs is 100 percent efficient. Not all water\napplied during the irrigation enters and is held in the\nplant root zone. Also, all irrigation systems have a\ndistribution uniformity less than 100 percent. Applying\ntoo much water too soon (poor irrigation water man-\nagement) causes the greatest overuse of water. Irriga-\ntion systems and management techniques are available\nthat reduce the avoidable losses. They are described in\nchapters 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of this guide.\nUnavoidable losses are caused by:\n• Unequal distribution of water being applied\nover the field.\n• Deep percolation below the plant root zone in\nparts of the field.\n• Translocation or surface runoff in parts of the\nfield.\n• Evaporation from the soil surface; flowing and\nponded water.\n• Evaporation of water intercepted by the plant\ncanopy under sprinkler systems.\n• Evaporation and wind drift from sprinklers or\nspray heads.\n• Nonuniform soils.\nFor a given irrigation method and system, irrigation\nefficiency varies with the skill used in planning, de-\nsigning, installing, and operating the system.

The risk is greater when growing\ncrops on low AWC soils even in areas that have ad-\nequate rainfall during the growing season. When\ngrowing high value crops, an irrigation system and\nadequate water supply are highly desirable for insur-\nance against potential crop loss. A detailed economic\nanalysis should be completed to provide estimates of\noptimum net benefits. The analysis should include cost\nof water, pumping costs, reduced yields caused by\nreduced crop water use, and reduced tillage operation\ncosts. Subsequent management decisions should be\nbased on this analysis. See chapter 11 for additional\ndiscussion.\nIn some areas irrigation water delivery systems, in-\ncluding management, limit on-farm water management\nimprovements. Rotational delivery systems have the\nlowest on-farm water management potential, while on\ndemand delivery systems have the highest.\nImproving both management and the irrigation system\ncan reduce the amount of water applied and more\neffectively use existing water supplies. Improving\nwater management, including irrigation scheduling\nand adequate water measurement, is always the first\nrecommended increment of change.

Water can also be applied to cool plants\nto maintain product quality, to delay bud development,\nand to provide frost protection of buds, flowers, and\nyoung fruit.\n(a) High temperatures\nExtremely high temperatures can\n• put plants into a temporary plant moisture\nstress,\n• hasten untimely fruit development and ripen-\ning,\n• cause moisture stress in ripening fruit,\n• sunburn berries and other fruit,\n• overheat bare soils during seed germination\n(i.e., lettuce), and\n• overheat standing water in basin irrigation.\nWater used for temperature modification as a crop and\nsoil coolant is typically applied with a sprinkler/spray\nsystem.\n(b) Low temperatures\nWhen temperatures drop below the critical tempera-\nture, damage can occur to both annual and perennial\nplants. If ambient air temperature and humidity are\nseverely low, permanent damage to fruit, citrus, and\nnut trees can occur.

Sprinkler/spray systems that apply water\noverhead onto the plant canopy are typically used.\nThis allows a protective layer of ice to build up on the\nleaves, blossoms, and buds. Frost protection involves\nheat release caused by changing water to ice. The\nprocess must be understood to determine the applica-\ntion rate and timing of water for adequate frost protec-\ntion.

When water is removed from the soil profile by\nplant transpiration and soil surface evaporation, salts\nremain in the soil profile and on the soil surface. If the\nsoil-water solute is high in sodium, the soil becomes\nsodic. All other ionic concentrations in solution (i.e.,\ncalcium, magnesium, potassium) cause salinity. These\nconditions are particularly common where most of the\ncrop water requirement comes from irrigation. The\nproblem eventually becomes serious if\n• irrigation or natural precipitation is not\nsufficient to leach the accumulating salts,\n• water and soil management are less than\nadequate,\n• soil and water amendments are inadequate, or\n• the soil is poorly drained.\nSalinity and sodicity problems can also develop as a\nresult of saline seeps, use of poor quality irrigation\nwater including flooding by brackish water near the\nocean, or by using drainage water from upslope irriga-\ntion. As salt concentrations increase above a threshold\nlevel, the growth rate, mature size of crops, and prod-\nuct quality progressively decrease.\nPrincipal objectives of water management are to\nmaintain soil tilth, soil-water content, and salinity and\nsodicity levels suitable for optimum plant growth. A\nnatural occurring internal drainage or an installed\ndrainage system within the usable soil profile is essen-\ntial. See Chapter 13, Quality of Water Supply, for\nadditional information.\n(b) Measuring salinity and\nsodicity concentration\nA method has been developed to measure and quantify\nsalinity and sodicity levels in soils. Thus, the salinity of\na soil can be determined by measuring the electrical\nconductivity, EC e, of the soil-water extract expressed\nin millimhos per centimeter or decisiemens per meter,\ncorrected to a standard temperature of 77 °F (25 °C).\n1 mmho/cm = 1 dS/m.\nSalt molecules in solution produce electrically-charged\nparticles called ions. Ions can conduct an electrical\ncurrent. The greater the concentration of ions in a\nsolution, the greater the electrical conductivity of the\nsolution.\nTo measure sodicity in soil, the Sodium Adsorption\nRatio (SAR) is used. It is a measure of the ratio of\nsodium to calcium plus magnesium present.\nSAR Na\nCa \tMg\n=\n+\t\n\n \n\n\n2\n1\n2\n(c) Effects of salinity on yields\nCrop yields and quality are reduced when salinity\nlevels exceed a certain threshold. See NEH, Part 623,\nIrrigation, Chapter 1, Soil-Plant-Water Relationships\n(table 1–8), and Chapter 2, Irrigation Water Require-\nments. The information presented provides two essen-\ntial parameters for expressing salt tolerance:\n• The salinity threshold level above which re-\nduced yield will occur\n• The percent yield reduction per unit salinity\nincrease beyond the threshold level\n(d) Effect of salinity and sodicity\non AWC\nPlants extract water from the soil by exerting an\nadsorptive force or tension greater than the attraction\nof the soil matrix for water. As the soil dries, remain-\ning water in the soil profile is held more tightly by soil\nparticles. Salts also attract water. The combination of\ndrying soils and elevated salt concentrations results in\nless water at a given tension being available for plant\nuptake. The reduction in water available to the crop as\nsalinity increases is evident in figure 2–7, chapter 2,\nwhich shows the volumetric water content versus soil-\nwater potential for a clay loam soil at various degrees\nof soil salinity, EC e. Table 2–4 provides a process to\nestimate AWC based on texture and ECe of 0 to 15\nmmho/cm.",

Most often,\nsalinity or sodicity is not maintained below plant\nthresholds because less than adequate soil and water\nmanagement practices are followed.\n(e) Management practices for\nsalinity and sodicity control\nThe major objective of salinity management is to keep\nsoil salinity and sodicity below thresholds for seed\ngermination, seedling establishment, crop growth, and\nquality while minimizing the salt loading effects of\ndrainage outflow. Procedures that require relatively\nminor changes in management are:\n• Improved irrigation water management\n• Improved crop residue management\n• Adding soil and water amendments\n• Selection of more salt-tolerant crops\n• Leaching with additional irrigation water\n• Preplant irrigations\n• Changing of seed placement on the furrow bed\nMaintaining a higher soil-water content decreases soil-\nwater tension; thereby, increasing water available to\nplants. Alternatives that require significant adjust-\nments are:\n• Changing the water supply\n• Changing irrigation methods\n• Land leveling for improvements to surface\ndrainage and irrigation water distribution\n• Modifying the soil profile\n• Providing for internal drainage\nASCE Report No. 71, Agricultural Salinity Assessment\nand Management (1990) gives specific recommenda-\ntions regarding salinity and sodicity assessment and\nmanagement.\nIrrigated agriculture cannot be sustained without\nadequate leaching and internal drainage to control\nbuildup of calcium, sodium, and other toxic ions in the\nsoil profile. Where subsurface drainage systems are\ninstalled to improve downward water movement and\nremoval of the required leaching volume, soluble salts\nplus other agricultural chemicals and fertilizers move\nwith the drainage water. They have the potential to\nmove to streams, wetlands, estuaries, and lakes.\nWhere possible, leaching events should be planned\nwhen soil nitrate levels are low. The leaching require-\nment for salinity control can be minimized with good\nirrigation water management and with adequately\ndesigned, installed, and operated irrigation water\ndelivery and application systems.\nDrainage outflow with high salt concentrations can be\ndisposed of through use of evaporation ponds (the\nsalts remain), or often water can be directly reused as\nan irrigation water supply for applications where\nsaline water is acceptable, such as irrigation of salt-\ntolerant plants or for industrial uses. In some areas\ndrainage outflow with high salt concentration may not\nbe allowed to be released to public waters without a\npoint-discharge permit, or it must be desalted. In most\nhigh salt content water reuse operations, the salt\nmoves and precipitates out at another spot. It does not\ngo away.\nWhen irrigating with high salt content water, internal\nsoil drainage and leaching are required to maintain an\nacceptable salt balance for the plants being grown.\nThe salt concentration in drainage outflow can be\nquite high, and concern for safe disposal still exists.\nSome saline and sodic tolerant crops require high\nquality water for germination and establishment. Once\nthe crop is established, poorer quality water can be\nused. Generally, water containing different saline-\nsodic concentrations should not be mixed.\n(f) Toxic elements\nToxicity problems can be the same or different from\nthose of salinity and sodicity because they can occur\nbetween the plant and the soil and may not be caused\nby osmotic potential or water stress. Toxicity normally\nresults when certain ions are present in the soil or\nabsorbed with soil-water, move with the plant transpi-\nration stream, and accumulate in the leaves at concen-\ntrations that cause plant damage. It also can result\nfrom water sprayed directly on leaf surfaces. The\nextent of the damage depends on the specific ion\nconcentration, crop sensitivity, crop growth stage, and\ncrop water use rate and time.\nThe usual toxic ions in irrigation water include chlo-\nride, sodium, and boron. Excessive chlorine in domes-\ntic water systems and salts from water softeners in\nhome systems can also be a problem. Not all crops are",

Chemical analysis of plant tissue, soil-water\nextract, and irrigation water is most commonly used to\nidentify toxicity problems.\nThe affect of toxic elements (i.e., selenium) on water-\nfowl from drainage outflow has also been observed in\nseveral areas. Toxic elements that occur naturally in\nthe soil (i.e., selenium and boron) in high concentra-\ntions or were used as pesticide control in past years\n(i.e., arsenic and mercury) are of great concern.

Daily and weekly crop water use estimates\nare needed to schedule irrigation applications and\ndetermine minimum system capacities. Seasonal or\nannual water use is required to size irrigation reser-\nvoirs and diversion facilities and to establish water\nrights. Therefore, a procedure to determine both short-\nand long-term rates of water use is necessary. Chapter\n2, Irrigation Water Requirements, NEH, Part 623,\ndescribes the processes needed to determine crop\nevapotranspiration and irrigation water requirements\nfor a crop, field, farm, and project.\nCrop evapotranspiration (ETc), sometimes called crop\nconsumptive use, is the amount of water that plants\nuse in transpiration and building cell tissue plus water\nevaporated from an adjacent soil surface. Crop evapo-\ntranspiration is influenced by several major factors:\nplant temperature, ambient air temperature, solar\nradiation (sunshine duration/intensity), wind speed/\nmovement, relative humidity/vapor pressure, and soil-\nwater availability. Daily, weekly, monthly, and sea-\nsonal local crop water use requirements must be\nknown. These data are essential for planning, design-\ning, and operating irrigation systems and for making\nirrigation management decisions, such as determining\nwhen and how much to irrigate.\nSeasonal water requirements, in addition to crop water\nneeds, may also include water used for preplant irriga-\ntion, agricultural waste application, leaching for salt\ncontrol, temperature control (for frost protection, bud\ndelay, and cooling for product quality), chemigation,\nfacilitation of crop harvest, seed germination, and dust\ncontrol.\n652.0401 \tMethods for\ndetermining crop evapo-\ntranspiration\n(a) Direct measurement of crop\nevapotranspiration\nDirect measurement methods for ET c include:\n• aerodynamic method\n• detailed soil moisture monitoring\n• lysimetry\n• plant porometers\n• regional inflow-outflow measurements\nAll these methods require localized and detailed mea-\nsurements of plant water use. Detailed soil moisture\nmonitoring in controlled and self-contained devices\n(lysimeters) is probably the most commonly used.\nLittle long-term historical data outside of a few ARS\nand university research stations are available. Use of\nlysimetry is discussed in more detail in Chapter 2,\nIrrigation Water Requirements, NEH, Part 623. The use\nof soil moisture monitoring devices to monitor crop\nET is described in NEH, Part 623, Chapter 1, Plant-\nSoil-Water Relationships.\n(b) Estimated crop evapo-\ntranspiration—ETc\nMore than 20 methods have been developed to esti-\nmate the rate of crop ET based on local climate fac-\ntors. The simplest methods are equations that gener-\nally use only mean air temperature. The more complex\nmethods are described as energy equations. They\nrequire real time measurements of solar radiation,\nambient air temperature, wind speed/movement, and\nrelative humidity/vapor pressure. These equations\nhave been adjusted for reference crop ET with lysim-\neter data. Selection of the method used for determin-\ning local crop ET depends on:\n• Location, type, reliability, timeliness, and\nduration of climatic data;\n• Natural pattern of evapotranspiration during\nthe year; and\n• Intended use intensity of crop evapotranspira-\ntion estimates.",

Some\nearlier reference crop research, mainly in the West,\nused 2-year-old alfalfa (ET r).

The following\nmethods and equations used to estimate reference\ncrop evapotranspiration, ETo , are described in detail in\nPart 623, Chapter 2, Irrigation Water Requirements\n(1990). The reference crop used is clipped grass. Crop\ncoefficients are based on local or regional growth\ncharacteristics. The following methods are recom-\nmended by the Natural Resources Conservation Ser-\nvice (NRCS).\n(1) Temperature method\n• FAO Modified Blaney-Criddle (FAO Paper 24)\n• Modified Blaney-Criddle (SCS Technical Re-\nlease No. 21). This method is being maintained\nfor historical and in some cases legal signifi-\ncance. See appendix A, NEH, Part 623, Chapter\n2, Irrigation Water Requirements.\n(2) Energy method\n• Penman-Monteith method\n(3) Radiation method\n• FAO Radiation method (FAO Paper 24)\n(4) Evaporation pan method\nThe FAO Modified Blaney-Criddle, Penman-Monteith,\nand FAO Radiation equations represent the most\naccurate equations for these specific methods. They\nare most accurately transferable over a wide range of\nclimate conditions. These methods and equations are\nalso widely accepted in the irrigation profession today\n(ASCE 1990).\nThe intended use, reliability, and availability of local\nclimatic data may be the deciding factor as to which\nequation or method is used. For irrigation scheduling\non a daily basis, an energy method, such as the Pen-\nman-Monteith equation, is probably the most accurate\nmethod available today, but complete and reliable\nlocal real time climatic data must be available. For\nirrigation scheduling information on a 10+ day average\nbasis, use of a radiation method, such as FAO Radia-\ntion, or use of a local evaporation pan, may be quite\nsatisfactory.\nFor estimation of monthly and seasonal crop water\nneeds, a temperature based method generally proves\nto be quite satisfactory. The FAO Modified Blaney-\nCriddle equation uses long-term mean temperature\ndata with input of estimates of relative humidity, wind\nmovement, and sunlight duration. This method also\nincludes an adjustment for elevation. The FAO Radia-\ntion method uses locally measured solar radiation and\nair temperature.",

To provide the required flows, daily (or\nseveral day averages) crop ET rate for the peak month\nmust be used.\nEstimated daily crop ET is not the average daily use\nfor longer time periods. Daily crop ET is best esti-\nmated using real time day-specific information and the\nappropriate ET equation.\n652.0403 \tNet irrigation\nwater requirement\nThe net irrigation water requirement is defined as the\nwater required by irrigation to satisfy crop evapotrans-\npiration and auxiliary water needs that are not pro-\nvided by water stored in the soil profile or precipita-\ntion. The net irrigation water requirement is defined as\n(all values are depths, in inches):\nF \tET \tA \tP \tGW \tSW\tn \tc \tw \te\t= \t+ \t− \t− \t− ∆\nwhere:\nFn \t= net irrigation requirement for period consid-\nered\nET c \t= crop evapotranspiration for period consid-\nered\nAw \t= auxiliary water—leaching, temperature\nmodification, crop quality\nPe \t= effective precipitation during period consid-\nered\nGW \t= ground water contribution\n∆SW = change in soil-water content for period\nconsidered\nEffective precipitation is defined as that portion of\nprecipitation falling during the crop growing period\nthat infiltrates the soil surface and is available for\nplant consumptive use. It does not include precipita-\ntion that is lost below the crop root zone (deep perco-\nlation), surface runoff, or soil surface evaporation.\nAlong with meeting the seasonal irrigation water\nrequirement, irrigation systems must be able to supply\nenough water during shorter periods. The water sup-\nply rate generally is expressed in acre inches per hour\nor acre inches per day and can be easily converted to\ncubic feet per second or gallons per minute (1 ft3/s = 1\nac-in/hr = 450 gpm). The simplified equation can be\nused:\nQT \tDA\t=\nwhere:\nQ = flow rate, acre-inch per hour\nT = time, hours\nD = depth, inches (water applied or crop ET)\nA = area, acres",

It must ac-\ncount for the efficiency of the irrigation decisionmaker\nto schedule the right amount of water at the right time\nand the ability of an irrigation system to uniformly\napply that water across a field. Net and gross water\napplication and system capacity are related by an\nestimated or measured application efficiency:\nF F\nE\ng n\na\n= \tC C\nE\ng n\na\n=\nwhere:\nFg \t= gross application, inches\nFn \t= net application, inches\nEa \t= application efficiency, expressed as decimal\nCg \t= gross system capacity, gallons per minute\nCn = net system capacity, gallons per minute\nThe designer must also account for system down time,\ni.e., moving of sprinklers, break downs, and water\nused on another field or by another irrigator, such as\nin a rotation delivery schedule. For sprinkler systems,\nit is common to use 22 hours per day or 6 days per\nweek for actual water application time.\nThe most conservative method of designing irrigation\nsystem capacity is to provide enough capacity to meet\nthe maximum expected or peak evapotranspiration\nrate of the crop. This normally is the peak daily rate,\nbut can be any selected period. In the most conserva-\ntive case, rainfall and stored soil moisture are not\nconsidered. This design procedure relies on determin-\ning the distribution of crop ET during the year for the\nprinciple irrigated crops. The crop ET for the peak\nday, week, and month also varies from year to year. A\nfrequency or risk analysis can be provided whereby\nsystem capacity and related cost reduction may be\nrealized. Where effective rainfall and maximum avail-\nable soil-water storage are used, further reduction of\nsystem capacity and water supply may be realized.\nSee NEH, Part 623, Chapter 2, Irrigation Water Re-\nquirements, for further information on determining net\nirrigation requirement.\nTable 4–1 displays an example calculation and tabular\nmethod of presenting monthly crop ET, effective\nprecipitation (Re), and net irrigation requirement\n(NIR) for pasture grass using FAO Blaney-Criddle\nequation. When determining crop ET from TR-21\n(Modified Blaney-Criddle), crop ET was calculated\nand displayed using normal and dry years. Normal\nyear (50% chance occurrence) precipitation would be\nequaled or exceeded in 1 out of 2 years. Dry year (80%\nchance of occurrence) precipitation would be equaled\nor exceeded 8 out of 20 years.\nThis process carried through the many computer\nsoftware programs that were developed and became\navailable in many states. However, computer software\nprograms that have been developed when using FAO\nBlaney-Criddle equation, do not contain the normal\nand dry years calculation process. The normal and\ndry year concept for determining crop ET can still be\nused; however, basic input data of precipitation must\nbe adjusted. Long-term mean data are typically dis-\nplayed in NOAA climate data publications, and a\nfrequency analysis must be obtained or provided to\ndetermine dry year precipitation. This concept can\nalso apply to determination of crop ET during wet\nyears.\nFigure 4–1 displays monthly crop ET and monthly\neffective precipitation for an arid climate condition\nwhere effective precipitation during growing season is\nminimal. Figure 4–2 shows monthly crop ET and\neffective precipitation for a subhumid climate condi-\ntion where effective precipitation can meet crop ET\nduring the early and latter part of the growing season.\nNote: Where precipitation exceeds crop evapotranspi-\nration, an opportunity exists for leaching of nutrients\nand pesticides. This may occur if soil moisture is at\nfield capacity so that precipitation will provide the\nexcess soil water available for leaching. These displays\nare then basic water budgets in graphic form.",

Reasonable estimates need to be made of the\nwater supplied by a water table. See figure 2–6 in\nchapter 2 of this guide. Methods to predict upward\nsoil-water flow rates (upflux) from a water table are\ngiven in NEH Part 623, Chapter 2, Irrigation Water\nRequirements, and in the water table management\nsoftware program DRAINMOD. Soil parameters re-\nquired for these procedures are quite variable and may\nrequire field data to evaluate specific sites.\n652.0407 \tWater require-\nments for soil-water\nbudget/balance analysis\nThe components of a soil-water budget/balance analy-\nsis must include all water going in and all water going\nout of an area for the period of consideration. The\nbasic purpose for such an analysis is to determine the\nlocation of all water applied. Generally a soil-water\nbudget analysis is determined for a period involving a\nmonth, an irrigation season, a year, or maybe even for\nan average over several years. Availability of climatic\ndata may also dictate the time period for the analysis.\nFor example, if long-term mean temperature is the\nonly reliable data available, determining monthly and\nseasonal water requirements may be the most accu-\nrate analysis that can be done. This would dictate a\nreasonably accurate analysis period of a month or\nlonger.\nIf complete and reliable daily climatic data (tempera-\nture, solar radiation, wind movement, and relative\nhumidity) are available nearby, then a daily soil-water\naccounting or balance can be developed because\naccurate daily water requirements can be estimated.\nThe soil-water budget/balance analysis process is a\ntool that can be used for determining gross water\napplied and contributions of irrigation water and\nprecipitation to downstream surface water and ground\nwater. The soil-water budget/balance can be displayed\nin equation form as follows (sum may be positive if\nsoil water is stored in the plant root zone):\nF \tET \tA \tD \tRO \tSDL \tP \tGW \tSW\tg \tc \tw \tP\t= \t+ \t+ \t+ \t+ \t− \t− \t− ∆\nwhere:\nFg \t= Gross irrigation water applied during the\nperiod considered\nET c \t= Crop evapotranspiration during the period\nconsidered\nAw \t= Water applied for auxiliary purposes during\nthe period considered\nDp \t= Deep percolation below the root zone from\nirrigation and precipitation\nRO \t= Surface runoff that leaves the site from\nirrigation and precipitation",

Typically all factors\nwould not be used for an analysis of one site.\nGenerally the soil-water budget analysis can be\nthought of as supporting a planning process where the\nsoil-water balance analysis can be thought of as sup-\nporting an operational process. With appropriate soil-\nwater content monitoring, accurate estimated daily\ncrop ET and measurement of system inflow and sur-\nface outflow, a reliable daily soil-water balance can be\ndeveloped. These daily values can be summarized for\nany desirable longer period that data are available.\nThe period of reliable climatic data is key to the soil-\nwater budget/balance analysis. For development of a\nsoil-water balance, only immediate past events are\nevaluated. It is not an irrigation scheduling tool. For\nexample, a soil-water balance is an analysis process of\nwhat water went where for the last year, last month,\nlast week, last event, or from some specific date up to\nthe present time. Each rainfall and irrigation event\nversus daily crop ET and soil-water content change\ncan be evaluated. It requires appropriate and current\nmonitoring of soil-water content, irrigation water\napplied, onsite rainfall measurement, runoff, and full\nclimatic data for daily crop ET determination.\nFor development of a soil-water budget, historic\nclimate data along with estimated or measured soil-\nwater content, irrigation flows, and losses would be\nused. The time period for an analysis for an average\ncondition is whatever is necessary to provide reliable\ndata. As an example, a site with fairly consistent\nclimate from year to year, but with a rather short\nnumber of years record, might provide satisfactory\nresults. Whereas a site with wide ranging climate from\nyear to year might require a much longer period of\nrecord. An analysis showing the average for the last 5\nyears, or for a specific year of importance, could use\nclimate data for that specific period only.\nTable 4–2 displays a simple and basic soil-water bud-\nget using assumed and estimated values. The input\ndata can be refined to whatever degree is necessary\nwith field observations or measurements, or both. In\nthis table, a water surplus of 1.7 inches for the season\nis indicated, and the water will go into deep percola-\ntion below the root zone.\nA soil-water budget can be developed for planning\npurposes or as an evaluation tool. As the example\nshows, the consultant can use any level of accuracy\ndesired or necessary.\n(a) Example soil-water budget\nA simplified soil-water budget would be displayed\nusing the following assumptions:\n• Crop is grain corn.\n• Mature rooting depth = 48 inches.\n• Total AWC = 8.0 inches.\n• MAD = 50%.\n• Soil profile is at field capacity at start of\nseason.\n• Sprinkler irrigation system with gross\napplication for each irrigation = 6.0 inches.\n• Application efficiency of 67% providing a net\napplication = 4.0 inches.\n• DU = 100% with no surface runoff.\n• Precipitation infiltration for all season = 70%\nof total.\n• No contribution from a shallow water table.\nAll crop ET, irrigation, and precipitation units are in\ninches.\nAdditional and more detailed examples of a soil-water\nbudget and a soil-water balance are in Chapter 8,\nProject and Farm Irrigation Water Requirements.",

The\nselection should be based on a full awareness of\nmanagement considerations, such as water source and\ncost, water quantity and quality, irrigation effects on\nthe environment, energy availability and cost, farm\nequipment, product marketability, and capital for\nirrigation system installation, operation, and mainte-\nnance. The purpose of this chapter is to provide neces-\nsary planning considerations for selecting an irrigation\nmethod and system. Most widely used irrigation meth-\nods and systems with their adaptability and limitations\nare described. Also see National Engineering Hand-\nbook (NEH), part 623 (section 15), chapters 3, 4, 5, 6,\n7, 8, 9, and 11.\nIn some areas, operators are accustomed to a particu-\nlar irrigation method and system of applying water.\nThey continue to install and use this common system\neven though another system may be more suitable,\napply water more efficiently with better distribution\nuniformity, be more economical to install and operate,\nand have fewer negative impacts on ground and sur-\nface water.\nThe consultant and irrigation decisionmaker should\ncompare applicable methods and systems on common\ngrounds. These can include:\n• Gross irrigation water needs\n• Energy requirements\n• Effects on quantity and quality of ground water\nand downstream surface water\n• Installation and annual operating costs\n• Labor skills needed\nGenerally more than one irrigation method and system\ncan be installed and efficiently operated on a specific\nsite. The owner’s or operator’s desire, rather than\neconomics and water application uniformity, may be\nkey to the selection. To get acceptable irrigation\nefficiencies (minimize losses), management skills\nrequired of the operator and flexibility of available\nlabor must be considered. Local regulations may\nprovide the motivation to select and manage a specific\nirrigation system that would provide the least negative\neffect on ground and surface water. Whatever basis is\nused for the decision, the consultant and owner or\noperator both need to be aware of the applicability,\ncapability, and limitations of all irrigation methods and\nsystems that could be used on a specific site.\nPolitical, legal, and regulatory issues are of primary\nimportance. Included are such issues as land reform,\nwater rights, containment of runoff and drainage\nwater, taxation, financial incentives from govern-\nments, zoning and site application, and construction\npermits. These issues must be fully understood at the\nbeginning of the selection process.\nThe Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)\nField Office Technical Guide, section V, displays the\nconservation effects of irrigation methods and systems\nand their related components. These should be refer-\nenced during the planning and design process. They\nwill provide insight as to the effects of surface irriga-\ntion on ground and surface water quantity and quality,\nand on wildlife.",

Sprinkler\nirrigation systems include solid set, handmove laterals,\nsideroll (wheel) laterals, center pivot, linear move\n(lateral move), and stationary and traveling gun types.\nLow Energy Precision Application (LEPA) and Low\nPressure In Canopy (LPIC) systems are included with\nsprinkler systems because they use center pivots and\nlinear move irrigation systems.\nMicro—Water is applied to the point of use through\nlow pressure, low volume discharge devices (i.e., drip\nemitters, line source emitters, micro spray and sprin-\nkler heads, bubblers) supplied by small diameter\nsurface or buried pipelines.\nSubirrigation—Water is made available to the crop\nroot system by upward capillary flow through the soil\nprofile from a controlled water table.\nEach irrigation method and irrigation system has\nspecific site applicability, capability, and limitations.\nBroad factors that should be considered are:\n• Crops to be grown\n• Topography or physical site conditions\n• Water supply\n• Climate\n• Energy available\n• Chemigation\n• Operation and management skills\n• Environmental concerns\n• Soils\n• Farming equipment\n• Costs",

For ex-\nample, it has been demonstrated that micro systems\ncan be economically used on high value annual and\nperennial crops. However, high quality water from a\nsuitably treated or filtered source is required to mini-\nmize emitter plugging, especially when using buried\nlaterals having line-source emitters. Any properly\ndesigned, installed, and managed irrigation method\nand system, that is suitable to the site, has the poten-\ntial to apply the proper amount of water uniformly\nacross the field. However, one or more systems can be\nless costly and easier to manage.\nLocal regulatory standards and criteria for irrigation\nefficiency, maximum water duty, or maximum water\nlosses may strongly recommend the selection of one\nor two specific irrigation systems so that water is\napplied without excessive negative impacts on local\nwater quantity and quality. The fact that the best\nplanned, designed, and installed system can still be\ngrossly mismanaged must also be recognized. Avail-\nability of irrigation equipment replacement parts,\nrepair service, skilled labor for system operation, and\nirrigation water availability and timing must be consid-\nered. Minimizing total annual operating energy require-\nments should be a basic part of the decisionmaking\nprocess.\nTwo irrigation methods (i.e., sprinkle and surface) and\nsystems for the same field can be efficiently used with\ndifferent crops and even a single crop for one season.\nFor example, with an annual crop such as corn on high\nintake soils, early season shallow irrigations can be\nprovided to the shallow rooted corn plants by\nhandmove or sideroll (wheel) sprinkler laterals. After\nthe corn gets too tall for the moving of laterals and the\nwater infiltration rate is slowed by tillage equipment\ncompaction, furrow irrigation can then be used for the\nremainder of the season. Compared to a full irrigation\nseason using furrows, less water is applied and fewer\nplant nutrients and pesticides are lost to deep percola-\ntion below the root zone. In cranberry bogs, sprinklers\ncan be used for irrigation, frost control, and chemical\napplication, or bogs can be flooded for irrigation and\nfrost control. Lettuce, carrots, onions, and other such\ncrops can be germinated with portable fixed set sprin-\nkler laterals with furrows used to apply water the\nbalance of the growing season.\nWhere ample water is available during the early part of\nthe growing season, but becomes deficient during the\npeak water use period, a surface flood system (i.e.\nborders) can be used in the spring and a sprinkler\nsystem used during peak water use. Several benefits\ncan be realized with both irrigation methods:\n• Reduced energy use compared to pumping the\nfull flow for the full season\n• Maximized water use efficiency during the\npeak water use period\nThis scenario works well where surface water with\ngravity flow is available to the field and both a good\nsurface flood system and sprinkler system are avail-\nable or can be economically installed.\nSprinkler irrigation systems are adaptable for use on\nmost crops and on nearly all irrigable soils. Particular\ncare is needed in the design and operation of a sprin-\nkler system with low application rates (0.15 to .25 in/\nhr) and on soils (generally fine textured) with low\ninfiltration rates. Principal concerns with low applica-\ntion rates are time of set, increased system cost, ac-\nceptable distribution uniformity, wind drift, evapora-\ntion, and system operational requirements.\nFor example, with an application rate of 0.15 inch per\nhour, time of set would have to be nearly 30 hours to\napply a net irrigation application of 3 inches. It is\nrecommended that sprinkler systems apply water at a\nrate greater than 0.15 inch per hour for improved wind\nresistance. In areas of high temperature, wind, or both,\nminimum application rate and volume should be\nhigher because of potential losses from evaporation\nand wind drift. For frost control, where evaporation\nand wind drift potential are low, an application rate of\n0.10 to 0.15 inch per hour is common.

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation System Design\tChapter 6\n6–1\t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nChapter 6 \tIrrigation System Design\n652.0600 \tGeneral irriga-\ntion objective\nIrrigation systems should have the capability to apply\nthe amount of water needed by the crop in addition to\nprecipitation. Irrigation applications should occur in a\nuniform and timely manner while minimizing losses\nand damage to soil, water, air, plant, and animal re-\nsources. Some irrigation systems also include water\nsupply and delivery. Any irrigation system design\nrequires adjustment in the field. Designs must be\ntailored to the skills and willingness of the irrigation\ndecisionmaker to properly manage the system and\nmake the adjustments.\nTo properly design and manage irrigation water, flow\nrates must be known. Therefore, water measurement\nis essential for farm and field delivery. Measurement\nof irrigation water is described in chapter 8 of this\nguide.\n(a) System capacity requirements\nThe irrigation system must be able to deliver and apply\nthe amount of water needed to meet the crop-water\nrequirement. Along with meeting the seasonal water\nrequirements, systems must supply enough water to\nprevent daily crop-water stress by satisfying the differ-\nence between evapotranspiration demands and avail-\nable soil moisture supplied by rainfall or previous\nirrigations.\nThe irrigation decisionmaker must decide what water\nsupply rate(s) will be used for designing system capac-\nity. In arid and semiarid areas with high value crops, at\nleast 90 to 95 percent probability of peak daily plant\nevapotranspiration may be required. With medium\nvalue crops, 80 percent may be adequate; and with low\nvalue crops, 50 percent may be sufficient.\nIf the soil can only store and provide water for a few\ndays, meeting peak daily evapotranspiration rates may\nbe desirable. With medium textured soils in semi-\nhumid and humid climatic areas, values less than peak\ndaily rates may be sufficient, such as average daily rate\nfor the peak month. Potential prolonged drought\nperiods in any climatic area and high value crops may\njustify the higher cost of providing system capacity to\nmeet peak daily crop use rates. National Engineering\nHandbook (NEH), Part 623 (Section 15), Chapter 2,\nIrrigation Water Requirements, provides a good de-\nscription and examples for determining farm and\nproject water requirements.\nA system capacity greater than crop water use may be\nneeded for other uses, such as frost protection. For\nexample, where a sprinkler irrigation system is used\nfor frost protection of orchards, large blocks must be\ncontinuously sprinkled during critical cold tempera-\ntures. This may require lower application rates than\nirrigation application would require, but larger areas\nare probably sprinkled at one time, thus requiring\nlarger pumping plants and larger diameter distribution\nlines.\nTypically as water costs increase, farm managers\ninvest in better irrigation systems and management.\nThey use techniques that have the potential to mini-\nmize water use by more uniform water application\nacross the field and better control of the amount\nneeded and applied by each irrigation. Changing or\nimproving irrigation methods and systems may reduce\ntotal operating costs. However, even the most suitable\nirrigation system for a specific site can be misman-\naged.\n(b) Limiting factors\nLimiting factors to adequately operate an irrigation\nsystem on a specific site include soils, crop, water,\nclimatic conditions, and labor. See tables 5–3 through\n5–7 in Chapter 5, Selection of Irrigation Systems, for\nnegative, neutral, or positive factors affecting selection\nconsideration. Other limitations to consider are:\nSurface systems—High sediment laden irrigation\nwater generally reduces intake rates, which on coarse\ntextured soils may increase advance rates thereby\nimproving distribution uniformity for the field. On\nmedium and fine textured soils, a reduced intake rate\nmay be undesirable.\nGraded furrow systems—On furrow slopes greater\nthan 1 percent and on highly erodible soils, erosion\nrates can be severe unless protective measures are\nprovided.",

High uniformity can be attained with level\nbasins on medium and low intake rate soils.\nLow pressure continuous/self move center pivot and\nlinear systems—Requires intense water, soil, and plant\nmanagement for low intake soils, and at least a moder-\nate amount of management on low to medium intake\nsoils.\nMicro—Water quality must be high except for basin\nbubbler systems, which use plastic tubing of 3/8 inch\ndiameter and larger. Chemicals must be used to pre-\nvent algae growth in most systems.\n(c) System design\nAn irrigation guide is valuable by giving general guid-\nance for planning, design, layout, and operation of an\nirrigation system. Only application methods for which\nrational design methods exist are described. Wild\nflooding, border ditches, and nongraded furrows are\nnot included. Presently, the only practical way to\nimprove on the efficiency of these systems is by trial\nand error with adjustments being made during an\nirrigation.\nRational methods of design have their own limits. The\ndata that goes into any irrigation system design in-\ncludes two principal factors—soil intake rate and net\napplication per irrigation. In some areas timing and\navailability of water can be a consideration for surface\nsystems; additional principal factors are flow rate and\nerosion resistance. These factors are highly variable\nand can change with soil condition, from one field to\nanother, for each crop stage of growth, from crop to\ncrop, and from the first part of the season to the last\npart. The physical layout of a system can be installed\naccording to data from the guide. Operational adjust-\nments then must be made for differing field and crop\nconditions.\nDesign standards for irrigation practices are contained\nin the NRCS National Handbook of Conservation\nPractices, and Section IV of the Field Office Technical\nGuide.\n652.0601 \tSurface\nirrigation\n(a) General\nThe surface irrigation method is the application of\nirrigation water to the soil surface by gravity. Applica-\ntion systems vary. It is necessary to understand that a\nvolume balance of water in a surface irrigation system\nmust exist at all times. All water introduced at the\nhead end of the system must be accounted for in\nsurface flow or storage, infiltration, runoff, and a very\nsmall amount lost to evaporation during the time of\nirrigation. The amount lost to evaporation is generally\nneglected. In the overland flow process, an energy\nbalance also exists. Flow or volume measurements\ncan account for inflow, surface storage, and runoff.\nInfiltration volume can be measured by changes in\nsoil-water content in the root zone before and after\nirrigation, with the remainder going to deep percola-\ntion below the plant root zone.\n(1) Description and stages of typical surface\nwater movement\nInflow—Irrigation stream flowing into a furrow,\ncorrugation, rill, border, basin, or field.\nAdvance stage—Process of the leading edge of water\nmoving across the field either in channel or as over-\nland flow.\nAdvance rate—Time or rate at which the advance\nfront moves across the field.\nStorage stage—That portion of time or volume\noccurring between end of advance (or shutoff) and\nstart of recession time, generally measured between\nspecific points (and time) during an irrigation.\nRecession stage (rate)—That portion of the irrigation\ntime between inflow shutoff and beginning of reces-\nsion at the upper end of the field. Recession rate is the\nrate at which the recession front moves over the\nsurface. To be practical, recession ends when less than\n10 percent of the wetted soil surface is covered by\nwater.",

The basin (borders) may\nbe any shape and is surrounded on all boundaries by a\ncontrol barrier, such as a low dike or levee. The water\nis confined until infiltrated into the soil.\nLevel basins have been used for many years for irrigat-\ning orchards, citrus, grapes, alfalfa, small grains, and\ngrass pasture. Similar to the level basin principal,\ncontour levee irrigation has been used for centuries\nfor growing rice.\nDesign of basin size depends on water supply flow\nrate, soil intake characteristics, and available soil\nwater capacity. Basin irrigation can be adapted to\nmost crops and certain marginal quality water not\nusable in other methods of irrigation. This system is\nbest adapted for low to medium intake soils, where\ninfiltration tends to be more uniform.\nWith proper design and management, level basin\nsystems can result in high distribution uniformity and\nhigh overall application efficiency. Application effi-\nciencies of individual irrigation events exceeding 90\npercent can be obtained. Lack of uniformity in soil\nintake characteristics across the basin can reduce\ndistribution uniformity of water infiltrated, as can\nusing inadequate inflow rates.\n(1) Advantages\n• Level basin irrigation systems are the easiest to\nmanage of any system. Application volume is\ncontrolled by inflow time of set, assuming inflow\nrate is known.\n• Properly designed and managed level basin\nsystems minimize deep percolation losses and\nhigh application efficiencies are attained. Distri-\nbution uniformity can be greatly improved over\nother irrigation systems. There is no runoff\nexcept for rice where flow through water is used\nto maintain the desired water surface elevation.\n• Leaching saline, sodic, and other toxic ions is\neasier than with other methods. The reason for\nthis is that water covers the entire soil surface\nuniformly and at a reasonably uniform depth.\nThe water has the opportunity to infiltrate\nevenly, thereby reducing residual salts that often\nremain with graded border irrigation. Rainfall\ndoes not run off, so it can also be used for leach-\ning. Leaching of toxic ions with level irrigation\nsystems may not be as water efficient as leaching\nwith sprinklers (unsaturated) because of some\nconcentration of flow in macro pores.\n• The guess work in applying the right amount of\nwater is reduced since there is no surface runoff\nand nearly all water applied to a basin is infil-\ntrated and used or lost to deep percolation\nwithin the basin.\n• Relatively light applications of water are pos-\nsible.\n• Automation can be adapted as follows: The time\nof set, thus the amount of water applied, can be\ncontrolled directly with time clock operated\ngates in both head ditch and turnout(s) into a\nbasin. However, with relatively large flows,\npowered gate control devices may require 110\nvolt power or a large battery(s). Drop open and\ndrop close gates that are operated by gravity and\nwater pressure against the head gate are avail-\nable.\n• Few turnout or outlet structures into a basin are\nneeded.\n• Except where rice fields are drained, no\ntailwater exists for further handling.\n• Level basin areas as large as 10 to 40 acres can\nbe irrigated when large streams are available and\nproper water control structures are used. Fields\ncan be farmed using large equipment.\n• Increased yields may result because more uni-\nform amounts of water can be applied. Uniform\ndistribution results in improved germination,\nimproved plant environment, and more uniform\ngrowth. Leaching of plant nutrients is controlled.\nKnowledge of required application volume and\ntiming is very important when using this irriga-\ntion system. Irrigation scheduling is discussed in\nChapter 9, Irrigation Water Management.\n• With operator-owned laser controlled equipment,\nannual maintenance or touch up can maintain\nfields in as designed condition. Laser controlled\nequipment can grade the surface to within about\n0.025 to 0.05 foot of design elevation. Growers\nhave discovered several advantages of annual\nlaser controlled land leveling or planing, espe-\ncially with grower owned equipment and with\nannual crops. Advantages of a near perfect\nsystem are realized every year instead of only the\nfirst year after leveling. Annual costs are about\nthe same as re-leveling every 3 to 4 years.",

If low or high areas exist, uneven\ninfiltration occurs and distribution uniformity is\nreduced.\n• Laser controlled leveling or surface planing\nequipment is almost essential to obtain uniform\nwater distribution and high irrigation efficien-\ncies.\n• The correct amount of water must be applied.\nOver-application of water can lead to excessive\nplant inundation, high water temperatures that\ndamage plants, leaching of nutrients, and the use\nof extra water. Too often when level basin irriga-\ntion systems are first installed, the irrigator tends\nto over irrigate, as 30 to 50 percent of water is no\nlonger lost to runoff.\n• To meet desirable basin size and shape objec-\ntives, earthwork volumes may be greater than for\nother surface irrigation methods.\n• Variable soil intake characteristics within a\nsingle basin can create poor water distribution\nuniformity.\n• Large basin inflow structures require erosion\ncontrol measures. More than one inlet onto a\nfield may be desirable.\n• Typically, surface drainage must be provided to\ndivert high rainfall events off the field.\n• Relatively large streams of water are needed and\nshould be used.\n• If the surface drainage system does not release\nprecipitation runoff in the natural drainage flow\npath, easements may be required.\n• Some direct evaporation when irrigating low\nintake soils results because of excessive infiltra-\ntion time (may be several hours). Also crop\nscalding can be a problem with some crops on\nlow intake soils in very hot climates.\n(3) Planning and design considerations\nFactors to be considered in system design include:\n• Intake characteristics of the soil can change\nthroughout the season as farm equipment com-\npacts the soil, from crop to crop, and from year\nto year.\n• Large flow rates are desirable to maximize distri-\nbution uniformity of infiltrated water and basin\nsize.\n• Flow resistance of the crop affects the minimum\nflow needed to provide uniform flow depth and\ntime of advance across the basin.\n• Net application of water (depth in inches) can\nchange as different crops are grown and as crop\nrooting depth increases during the season. Typi-\ncally time is varied rather than flow rate.\n• Available water capacity of soil in the actual\nplant root zone can vary because depth varies\nwith root development.\n• Topographic and soils characteristics of the site\ninfluence basin shape, earthwork required, and\nthe size of basins and fitting basins within areas\nof uniform soils. Hydraulically, basins do not\nhave to be rectangular. Often earthwork volumes\ncan be reduced if nonrectangular shapes are\nused.\nWith this information, the length and width (or shape\nand size) of basins can be designed to obtain high\ndistribution uniformity and acceptable application\nefficiencies. Basins that have the same size and shape\nare desirable, but not required.\nIn general, the entire basin should be covered by water\nin less than half of the total required irrigation oppor-\ntunity time. For highest distribution uniformity, total\ncoverage should take place within a fourth of the\nrequired irrigation opportunity time. This minimizes\nthe effect of variability of soil intake rates and irregu-\nlarities in the field surface.\nTo maximize distribution uniformity on basins, the\ninflow rate must be known, the design inflow time\nmust be monitored, and water must be applied accord-\ning to crop needs and soil conditions. Measuring\ndelivery inflow is essential to knowing the inflow rate\n(Q). If a large delivery inflow is split into two or more\nflows for irrigation heads, additional measurement\nmay be needed.\nCarefully monitoring of design inflow time (T) is\nessential, especially when using large flows and short\nirrigation sets. For example, with inflow Q = 15 ft3/s,\nand design opportunity time T = 35 minutes, an extra\nturn-on time of 10 minutes can increase the applied\ndepth of water 29 percent. An extra turn-on time of\nonly 5 minutes means an increase of 14 percent. Care-\nless timing can change a season long irrigation effi-\nciency from good to mediocre or poor quickly. The\nirrigator must change heads of water when needed\nrather than convenient. This is a big step in proper\nwater management.",

Design procedures and examples provided\nin section 652.0605 are developed from state approved\ncomputer programs using existing methodology from\nchapters 4 and 5 of this guide or from ARS publication,\nSurface Irrigation Model, SRFR.\n(c) Contour levee (rice lands)\nContour levee irrigation is similar to level basin irriga-\ntion except when growing rice. Water is retained by\nsmall dikes or levees that are constructed generally on\nthe contour. Additional leveling may be required to\nsquare up fields or to widen the contour dike interval.\nWhere rice is grown, water is applied to the level or\nnearly level area (basins) between levees at a rate (in\nexcess of the intake rate of the soil) to maintain\nponding. Flow-through water is used to maintain a\npreselected water surface elevation; thus some\ntailwater may be occasionally discharged from the\nlowest basin. This water can contain undesirable\nchemicals.\nAutomated static non flow-through systems are being\ndeveloped in some areas to reduce water use and\ndownstream surface water pollution. These systems\nmust consider water surface distortion by wind in\naddition to water surface evaporation and plant tran-\nspiration. Water surface sensors are used to monitor\nwater depth in each basin. Two to four water surface\nsensing stations in each basin are recommended.\nWhen the water surface lowers to a predetermined\nlevel, signals are transmitted to a controller at an inlet\nstructure to allow additional water to enter the basin.\n(1) Advantages\n• High irrigation efficiencies are obtainable on\nsoils that have a very low intake rate.\n• Maximum utilization of rainfall can be realized\nby maintaining water surface elevations slightly\nlower than flashboard crest elevations of water\ncontrol structures.\n• Uniform distribution of water and high applica-\ntion efficiency can be realized if flow-through\nwater is minimized or reused.\n• Runoff from rainfall can be handled with little\nadditional structure requirement.\n• Installation cost can be relatively low because\nland preparation is less where dikes and levees\nare installed on the contour. Size of areas be-\ntween levees doesn’t need to be uniform.\n• Simple water level control devices can be used.\nAutomation at inflow structures to maintain a\nconstant water level in the area between levees\ncan reduce labor requirements and tailwater\nlosses.\n(2) Limitations\n• Works best on soils that have a very low intake\nrate.\n• Soils having restriction to vertical water move-\nment, typically 18 to 30 inches below the soil\nsurface, minimize water lost to deep percolation.\n• Land grading is generally required to maximize\narea sizes between levees and provide a uniform\ndepth of water. Land leveling can be substantial\nif it is desirable to make all basins the same size.\n• Relatively large irrigation inflows are required to\nfill the basins. Flows larger than 5 ft3/s with\nsingle inlet structures require erosion protection.\n• Use is limited to soils with land slopes less than\n0.5 percent.\n• Residual pesticides can be carried downstream\ninto public water through tailwater discharge.\n• Surface drainage is required in high rainfall\nareas.\n(3) Planning & design considerations\nDesign considerations are based on three critical\nperiods of rice irrigation operation. They are flushing,\nflood establishment, and flood maintenance.\nFlushing—A water supply should be available to flush\nthe field between planting and flood establishment. To\nprevent seed development problems and plant stress,\nwater should not remain on the soil surface for more\nthan 3 days.\nFlood establishment—Flood establishment is the\napplication of water to inundate the soil surface to a\nplanned depth. A maximum flood-up period of less\nthan 6 days ensures uniform crop growth and matu-\nrity. Pump or diversion flow rates should be sufficient",

To maintain\ninundation, water must be added to replace crop\nevapotranspiration, lateral seepage losses of outside\nlevees, deep percolation, flow-through water, and less\neffective rainfall for the period. Average daily evapo-\ntranspiration should be used for planning and design\nso that the flood is maintained during the most critical\nperiods. Flow-through water should be minimized.\n(4) Design procedures\nBasic design principles and procedures are described\nin NEH, Section 15, Chapter 6, Contour Levee Irriga-\ntion, and in the Texas Rice Irrigation Guide.\n(d) Level furrows\nLevel furrow irrigation is similar to both level basin\nand graded furrow irrigation. Laser controlled land\nleveling is required for highest irrigation uniformity.\nIrrigation water must be applied rapidly, using as large\na stream as the furrow can contain, until the design\nvolume or depth of irrigation is applied. Dikes along\nedges of each irrigation set can be used to contain\nwater. The end of the furrow or field is blocked so the\nwater is contained and ponded within each furrow.\nThe same site conditions for level basins apply for\nlevel furrows. Level furrow irrigation is best suited to\nsoils that have a moderate to low intake rate and\nmoderate to high available water capacity.\n(1) Advantages\n• High application uniformity can be attained with\na properly designed and managed system.\n• Net irrigation application can be easily adjusted.\nLight applications can be applied where water\ncan be introduced at both ends of the furrow or\nwhere outflow into a lower basin is allowed.\n• There is no runoff from irrigation.\n• This system is well suited to automation (see\ndiscussion of level basin and borders).\n• Level basin (furrow) irrigation systems are the\neasiest to manage of all irrigation systems. Appli-\ncation volume is controlled by time, assuming\nthe inflow rate is known.\n(2) Limitations\n• Except on uniform flat fields, extensive land\npreparation is required for initial installation.\n• Typically, surface drainage must be provided to\ndivert high rainfall events off the field.\n• Set times are generally short requiring frequent\nchanges.\n• Relatively large streams of water are needed and\nshould be used.\n• Uniformity of the soil surface must be main-\ntained. This essentially requires the use of laser\ncontrolled grading and planing equipment. (This\nis true with all surface irrigation systems.)\n• Where land leveling activities (or natural condi-\ntions) expose soils with variable infiltration\ncharacteristics, infiltration uniformity can be\npoor.\n(3) Planning and design considerations\nFurrows should have adequate capacity for at least\nhalf the volume of the net irrigation application. Where\nit is undesirable to inundate a portion of the crop, or\nwhere the soil has low intake, the furrow cross section\nshould be large enough to contain all the volume or\ndepth of water applied per irrigation set.\n(4) Design procedures\nBasic design principles and procedures are described\nin NEH Part 623 (Section 15), Chapter 5, Furrow\nIrrigation, second edition. This chapter contains tables\nfor a limited selection of field conditions. Computer\nprograms are available that the planning technician\ncan use to facilitate design. Design procedures and\nexamples provided in section 652.0605 are developed\nfrom state approved computer programs using existing\nmethodology from chapters 4 and 5 of this guide or\nfrom ARS publication, Surface Irrigation Model,\nSRFR.\n(e) Graded borders\nGraded border irrigation is a surface irrigation system\nwhere controlled surface flooding is used. The field to\nbe irrigated is divided into strips of uniform width and\ngrade by parallel dikes or border ridges. Each strip is\nirrigated separately. Water is introduced at one end\nand progressively covers the entire strip.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation System Design\tChapter 6\n6–9\t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nIrrigation of graded borders is a balanced advance and\nrecession kind of water application. The borders\n(border strips) slope in the direction of irrigation, and\nthe ends are usually open. Each strip is irrigated by\ndiverting a stream of water onto the border at the\nupper end. The stream size must be such that the\ndesired volume of water is applied to the strip in a\ntime equal to, or slightly less than that needed for the\nsoil to absorb the net irrigation amount required.\nWhen the desired volume of water has been delivered\nonto the strip, the stream is turned off. Water tempo-\nrarily stored on the ground surface moves down the\nstrip to complete the irrigation.\nUniform and efficient application of water depends on\nthe use of an irrigation stream of proper size. Too\nlarge a stream results in inadequate irrigation at the\nupper end of the strip and often excessive surface\nrunoff at the lower end. If the stream is too small, the\nlower end of the strip is inadequately irrigated and the\nupper end has excessive, deep percolation. Chapter 9,\nIrrigation Water Management, discusses procedures to\nevaluate an irrigation event and develop necessary\nadjustments in flow and time of set.\n(1) Advantages\n• Water with relatively high suspended sediment\nloads can be used.\n• Graded borders can be used in rotation with other\nmethods and systems of applying water including\nsprinkler and furrow irrigation systems.\n• With proper system design and maintenance, this\nmethod requires relatively little labor. Labor can\nbe further reduced by system automation.\n• With properly designed and maintained systems\nand proper management, relatively high applica-\ntion efficiencies can be obtained on medium\nintake rate soils.\n• Distance between border dikes can be set to fit\nexisting cultivation and harvesting equipment.\nProperly designed and constructed dikes can be\ncrossed by equipment.\n(2) Limitations\n• Must have sufficient depth of soil after land\nleveling for growing crops.\n• To attain the best distribution uniformity, fre-\nquent observation (or automation) is required to\nshut off water at required times. Advancing\ntemporary surface storage completes irrigation\nof the lower part of the border.\n• Relative uniform topography is required to allow\nneeded land leveling.\n• Each border strip should have little or no cross\nslope.\n• Slope should be uniform in the direction of\nirrigation with no reverse slope.\n• A moderate level of irrigator skill and manage-\nment is required.\n• Uniform light applications of water are difficult\nto apply.\n(3) Planning and design consideration\nThe following factors must be considered in the design\nof a graded border system. When this information is\nknown, the border width, initial flow rates, and inflow\ntimes can be determined. Factors for consideration\nare:\n• Intake characteristics of the soil\n• Available flow rate\n• Flow resistance of the crop to be grown\n• Quantity (depth) of the water to be applied\n• Water quality\n• Slope\n• Erodibility of the soil\n• Available water capacity of soil in actual plant\nroot zone (depth varies with root development)\nAs a general rule for a properly designed and managed\ngraded border system, water should be shut off when\nthe wetting front has reached two-thirds to three-\nfourths of the border strip length. Detailed designs are\nbased on estimates of intake rates, net water applica-\ntion, crop flow restriction (roughness coefficient),\nerodibility of the soil, and net water application. All\nthese factors are variables even on the same soil type\nand the same field. For this reason designs must allow\nfor adjustments of flow rates, application times during\nsystem operation, or both. Some growers choose to\ndeficit irrigate lower portions of the field to conserve\nwater, reduce set time, and limit runoff.\nSlope in the direction of irrigation should not exceed\nthe following:\nArid & semiarid \t- - - - Humid - - - -\nnon-sod \tsod \tnon-sod \tsod\n2 % \t4 % \t0.5 % \t2 %",

Design procedures and examples provided in\nsection 652.0605 are developed from state approved\ncomputer programs using existing methodology from\nchapters 4 and 5 of this guide or from the ARS publica-\ntion Surface Irrigation Model, SRFR.\n(5) Modifications to graded border systems\nBorder surge (characteristics and design consider-\nations)—The general principles of surge irrigation\nwork with graded borders the same as they do with\ngraded furrows. The surge irrigation technique works\nbest where the soil infiltration rate needs to be re-\nduced (i.e., medium to coarse textured soils). Surge\nirrigation can be used to reduce both the net and total\ndepth of irrigation water applied. (See discussion of\nfurrow surge irrigation procedures later in this chap-\nter.) The main difference is that an automated system\ncapable of surging larger volumes of water to a single\nborder is required. This generally requires large gated\npipe or multiple risers. Developing equipment to\nautomate ditch turnouts has been attempted, but such\nequipment is not commercially available at the time of\nthis writing. Border surge can also be accomplished by\nusing a surge valve to split the water between two\nadjacent borders via open ended pipelines and short\nditches.\nBorder cablegation (characteristics and design\nconsideration)—Cablegation is an excellent way to\nautomate graded border systems providing the slope\n(fall) along the head ditch or supply pipeline is ad-\nequate. Approximately 0.2 foot per 1,000-foot grade is\nrequired on the supply pipeline at head ditch location.\nSee discussion of furrow cablegation irrigation proce-\ndures later in this chapter. Large diameter gated pipe\nis generally required to handle the larger inflows\nneeded for borders than that needed by furrows. This\nis a good way to provide accurate inflow times for\nshort borders that would otherwise take frequent\nvisits by the irrigator. One advantage with cablegation\nis that inflow times are easily changed by a simple\nadjustment of the cable speed controller. Water appli-\ncation design procedure is the same as for a manually\noperated system.\n(f) Graded furrow characteristics\nGraded furrow irrigation is a surface irrigation system\nthat applies water to the soil by allowing water to flow\ndownslope, in evenly spaced channels called furrows,\nrills, or corrugations. These small channels convey\nwater down the field to the plants either growing in\nthe furrows or on beds between the furrows. Graded\nfurrow systems differ from border irrigation in that\nonly part of the ground surface is covered with water.\nWater enters the soil by both vertically downward and\nlateral infiltration. The furrow stream is applied until\nthe desired application depth is obtained. The time\nthat water must be supplied to furrows is dependent\nupon the volume of water required to refill the soil\nprofile to the desired irrigation depth. The intake rate\nof the soil, spacing of furrows, and length of the field\nall affect the amount of water to be applied. Surface\ngrading (land leveling) to provide uniform slopes is\nessential to permit uniform water application and\nefficient irrigation.\nFurrow irrigation also includes applying water with\ncorrugations. Corrugations are typically used to irri-\ngate noncultivated close-growing field crops using\nsmall closely-spaced channels directed down the\nprimary slope of the field. Corrugations are also used\nto help guide irrigation streams in border strips. In this\ncase the design is based on the border design proce-\ndures instead of the furrow method. Corrugations are\nfrequently formed after the crop has been seeded,\nsuch as with small grains. In case of a perennial crop,\nsuch as alfalfa, they are reshaped as needed to main-\ntain the desired channel cross section. Water applica-\ntion principles are the same as for furrow, with spac-\ning, size, shape, and retardance characteristics being\nthe primary differences. Corrugation stream sizes are\nsmall in comparison to furrow streams, and lengths of\nrun are relatively short because of the smaller flows\ngenerally used and the resistance to flow caused by\nthe growing crops.\nCurrent ARS research and academia support the zero-\ninertia theory of surface irrigation, especially with\nfurrow irrigation in lieu of the process in NEH, Part\n623 (Section 15) Chapter 5, Furrow Irrigation.",

The\nfurrows and corrugations are constructed by\nreadily available and commonly used farm imple-\nments.\n• Water with relatively high suspended sediment\nloads can be used.\n(2) Limitations\n• Water erosion hazards may be high, depending\non field slope and soil texture. Erosion is of\nincreasing concern as farm managers become\nmore aware and as controls are placed on the\namount of sediment that may leave the field and\nenter public water bodies.\n• Tailwater (runoff) is nearly always required by\ngraded furrow irrigation to provide uniform or\nadequate irrigation in the lower part of the field.\n• To get adequate water infiltrated in the lower\nend of the field, the upper end is almost always\noverwatered resulting in deep percolation losses.\nGraded furrow system modifications, such as\ntailwater reuse, surge, and cablegation, can\nminimize deep percolation losses.\n• Salts from either the soil or water supply can\nconcentrate on ridges and beds. This can be a\nproblem during seed germination and early\nstages of plant development even with salt-\ntolerant crops. Planting on ridge slopes and good\nwater management help minimize this limitation.\n• With some low and high intake soils and wide\nplanting beds, lateral spread of water may not be\nadequate to provide complete irrigation across\nthe bed in a reasonable irrigation time.\n• With high intake soils the difference in intake\nopportunity time along the furrow, because of\nthe time required for the stream to advance, can\nmake it difficult to obtain high distribution\nuniformity. Furrow irrigation system modifica-\ntions, such as tailwater reuse, surge, and cut\nback, can minimize nonuniformity.\n• Furrows and corrugations create a rough field\nsurface, which is inconvenient to cross with farm\nequipment.\n• Labor requirements are high because irrigation\nstreams must be carefully regulated to achieve\nuniform advance and infiltration. Intake rate\nvaries with each furrow because of tillage equip-\nment compaction (soft versus hard furrow, or\nwheel versus nonwheel furrow) and can require\nadjustment of inflows in all furrows during the\nset. Adjustments of water inflow may be neces-\nsary several times during the set to maintain\nuniform advance rates in all furrows.\n• Adequate leaching of salts is more difficult than\nwith borders or sprinkler systems.\n• Land leveling and preplant land grading or plan-\ning is normally required to provide uniform\nfurrow grades.\n(3) Planning and design considerations\nFactors that must be considered in graded furrow\ndesign include:\n• Intake characteristics of the soil (or advance rate\nof known inflows).\n• Erodibility of the soil.\n• Available water supply.\n• Depth of water to be applied each irrigation.\n• Furrow spacing (distance between furrows in\nwhich water will be introduced). This is quite\nimportant when the irrigator is using inflows to\nalternate furrows.\n• Field slope in direction of irrigation and cross\nslope.\n• Length of furrows.\n• Flow resistance of crop to be grown.\n• Available water capacity of soil in plant root\nzone (depth of root zone varies with root devel-\nopment).\nWith this information the flow rate per furrow and\ninflow time can be designed for desirable uniformity.\nAmounts of deep percolation below the crop root zone\nand runoff can be estimated.\nOptimum distribution uniformity for a given system\noccurs when uniform grade is in the direction of\nirrigation.

In these cases the\nfurrows are along each pair of crop rows. See figure\n6–2. The size (width and depth) of furrows and the\nspacing between rows depend on: the soil type, the\ncrop, local cultural practices; and, on cultivation and\nharvesting equipment. Spacing of gates on gated pipe\nand setting of siphon tubes should match furrow\nspacing on field crops.\n(4) Design procedures\nBasic design principles and procedures are contained\nin NEH Part 623 (Section 15), Chapter 5, Furrow\nIrrigation and in ARS publication, SRFR, A computer\nprogram for simulating flow in surface irrigation,\nFurrows-Basins-Borders (WCL Report #17 1990).\nPlanning technicians can use design charts where they\nhave been prepared, do the calculations by using a\nsmall calculator, or by use of a computer. Many pro-\ngrams have been developed for computer use. One is\nthe ARS model, SRFR. See section 652.0605 for design\nprocedures and examples.\n(5) Modifications to graded furrow irrigation\nsystems\nSeveral modifications to graded furrow irrigation\nsystems can improve uniformity of applied and infil-\ntrated water and increase application efficiency. Some\nare quite easy and cost effective to automate. These\nmodifications will be described individually as design\nprocedures and field application techniques apply to\neach. The modifications include:\n(i) \tGraded furrow with cutback of inflow—In\nthis type of furrow system, a large flow of water is\ninitially turned into the furrow. When the water has\nnearly reached the end of the furrow, the inflow rate is\nreduced, or cutback. This procedure can increase\nuniformity of infiltrated water throughout the furrow\nlength and reduce runoff. This modification has not\nhad widespread use because of the additional labor\nrequired to manually reduce the flow rate and then\nreset the extra water that becomes available from the\ncutback. Cutback and resetting new water requires\ncontinual diligence by the irrigator to keep up with the\nnew turn-on and turn-off times. The cablegation tech-\nnique was developed as an attempt to automate cut-\nback systems.\nMost surge irrigation equipment has options available\nfor multiple half cycle times, for use when the water\nadvance reaches the end of the field. This \"soak cycle\"\napproximates a cutback system.\nThe following guidelines provide a practical procedure:\n• Cutback initial flow when water reaches about\nthree-fourths of the distance down the furrow.\n• The inflow rate is typically reduced to half the\ninitial rate.\n• The reduced inflow rate should be applied until\nthe desired application amount is reached.\nDesign procedures—Basic design principles and\nprocedures are discussed in NEH, Part 623 (Section\n15), Chapter 5, Furrow Irrigation. Design procedures\nand examples provided in section 652.0605 are devel-\noped from state approved computer programs using\nexisting methodology from chapters 4 and 5 of this\nguide or from ARS publication, Surface Irrigation\nModel, SRFR.",

The\nends of furrows are blocked, thereby ponding occurs\nin the lower part of the field. A tailwater ditch can be\nused to cause reverse flow in those furrows where\nwater has not reached the end of the furrow. Infiltra-\ntion is increased in this lower end. For best water\ndistribution uniformity, blocked end furrow irrigation\nsystems should pond water on the lower fourth to\nthird of the field. Care must be exercised not to flood\nthe plants in this area if they will not tolerate inunda-\ntion.\nSince runoff is eliminated, potential pollution from\nnutrients and pesticides to downstream surface water\ncan also be substantially reduced. However, all the\napplied irrigation water is now infiltrated, thereby\nincreasing the potential for pollution of ground water.\nOften blocking furrow ends only trades runoff for deep\npercolation loss. When converting to graded furrows\nwith blocked ends, adjustments to inflow rates and\npossibly set time are essential. Inflow rates and set\ntime are typically reduced. Blocked end furrow sys-\ntems work best on low gradient fields.\nAdvantages:\n• Eliminates runoff.\n• Application uniformity can be increased.\nLimitations:\n• Limited to field slopes where the backed up or\nponded area is between a fourth and a third of\nthe length of the field.\n• Furrows must have a large enough cross section\nto contain the ponded water.\n• An increase in labor is required to watch and\nadjust inflows to match advance and infiltration\nin all furrows and prevent dike overtopping at\nthe lower end.\nPlanning and design considerations:\nThe volume of water delivered to the furrow is equal\nto the average intake over the furrow length. The\ndesign of a graded furrow with blocked ends is similar\nto that for a level furrow in that the volume of inflow\nneeded to provide the desired amount of application is\nprovided to the furrow. Difficulty comes in accounting\nfor and adjusting inflows for individual furrow intake\ncharacteristics; i.e., hard versus soft furrows.\nDesign procedures:\nBasic design principles and procedures are presented\nin NEH, Part 623 (Section 15), Chapter 5, Furrow\nIrrigation, for level furrows. See section 652.0605 for\ndesign procedures and examples.\n(iii) Graded furrow with modified slope—Slope\nmodification to graded furrow irrigation has the poten-\ntial to increase uniformity of infiltrated water. The two\ntypes of slope modification are:\n• Slope that is gradually reduced throughout the\nentire length of the field.\n• Slope that is graded in the upper part of the field\nand level in the lower part.\nIn the first type, slope in the direction of irrigation is\ngradually reduced throughout the full length of the\nfield. Theory is to obtain a more uniform opportunity\ntime for infiltration throughout the furrow length.\nIncreased grades at the upper end decrease advance\ntime for water to reach the lower part of the field. The\nirrigator must adjust inflow rates to create a uniform\nadvance in all furrows. Adjustment throughout the\nseason is also usually required.\nIn the second type, slope in the direction of irrigation\ncan be divided into two parts—a graded upper field\nand a level lower field. Irrigation tailwater runoff from\nthe sloping upper field irrigates the lower field. Slope\nchanges typically occur at one-half, two-thirds, or\nthree-fourths of the total furrow length.\nModified slope furrow irrigation systems can have\nsome of the highest distribution uniformities of any\nsystem. However, they also require the most intense\nwater management.\nAdvantages:\n• High potential for increased irrigation unifor-\nmity.\n• Limited (or eliminated) tailwater runoff.\n• Decreased deep percolation.\nDisadvantages:\n• Higher irrigator skill and labor are required.\n• Adaptable only on certain topographic locations.\n• Most difficult of all irrigation systems to manage.\n• Works best for design conditions.\n• Requires adjusting furrow inflow rates through-\nout the season and from year to year.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation System Design\tChapter 6\n6–14 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nDesign procedures:\nDesign each slope section as a separate field. Except\nfor the upper most field where the water supply is in a\nhead ditch or pipeline, tailwater runoff from the higher\nelevation field is the furrow inflow for the next lower\nfield. Because of changing intake characteristics both\nseasonally and yearly, furrow inflow is difficult to\nproject for the lower fields. Typically lower value\ncrops are grown on the lowest field.\nPlanning and design considerations are the same as\nthose for graded furrow.\n(iv) Contour furrow—Where downslope irrigation\ngrade is excessive, the direction of irrigation furrows\ncan be turned cross slope or on the contour. This will\nreduce the furrow grade. Unless the field slope is quite\nuniform, irrigation grades can be variable; a factor that\ntends to reduce distribution uniformity, application\nefficiency, and to increase runoff. On moderately\nsloping land, a principal concern is the possibility of\nfurrow streamflows breaking across ridges or beds.\nThis is more of a problem with crops, such as onions\nand beans, where shallow furrows are used or where\nsurface residue is in the furrows. Where large water\nsupplies are available and land slope is nearly level,\nfurrows can be directed across the slope to convert a\ngraded furrow irrigation system to a level furrow\nsystem. This often delays land leveling cost by several\nyears.\nAdvantages:\n• Irrigation grades are decreased.\n• Erosion can be reduced.\n• Can be used on field slopes that exceed desirable\nirrigation grade.\n• Can minimize or delay land preparation costs.\nLimitations:\n• Point rows may result where field slopes are not\nuniform.\n• Head and tailwater ditches may be on erosive\ngrades.\n• Overtopping during precipitation events can\nincrease erosion.\n• High irrigator skill and labor are required.\n• Not suited to areas with high intensity rainfall\nevents unless adequate provisions are made to\ncontrol erosion.\nDesign procedures:\nDesign procedures for a contour furrow system are the\nsame as those for graded furrow.\n(v) \tLevel furrow—Furrows are on nearly flat or\nlevel grade. A constant flow rate is turned into each\nfurrow for the entire irrigation set. Flow rates and set\ntimes are designed to provide a desirable net applica-\ntion depth for a planned length of furrow. There is no\nrunoff. Where the tail end of furrows is connected with\na ditch, outflow from the faster advancing furrows can\nenter adjacent furrows from the tail end. This can\nimprove uniformity of infiltration throughout the field.\nTotal fall in the length of run cannot exceed half the\nnet depth of application.\nAdvantages (see section 652.0601(d):\n• High application uniformity can be attained.\n• Net irrigation application can be easily adjusted.\n• There is no irrigation runoff.\n• Well suited to automation.\n• Easiest to manage of all irrigation systems.\n• With a uniform water supply, time of set deter-\nmines application amount.\nLimitations (see section 652.0601(d):\n• Except on uniform flat fields, extensive land\npreparation is required for initial installation.\n• Providing surface drainage in moderate to high\nrainfall areas is essential.\n• Set times are generally short requiring frequent\nchanges.\n• Relatively large streams of water are needed and\nshould be used, otherwise infiltration uniformity\ncan be poor.\n• Uniformity of soil surface must be maintained.\n(vi) Graded furrow using surge technique—\nSurge irrigation is the intermittent application of water\nto furrows or borders creating a series of on-off peri-\nods of either constant or variable time intervals. Usu-\nally the water is alternated (switched) between two\nirrigation sets at predetermined, often varied time\nincrements until water has advanced to the end of the\nfield or until irrigation is complete. Surge has the\npotential, with good management, to significantly\ndecrease deep percolation and runoff, and signifi-\ncantly improve infiltration uniformity. Under some\nconditions it can reduce furrow erosion. Surge irriga-\ntion is most effective on fields where it is desirable to\nreduce soil intake rate.",

During the off\nperiod, water is applied to a second furrow typically\non a different set. Each time water is turned on, it\nprogresses more rapidly across the wetted area. More\nflow is then available to progress further down the dry\nfurrow. The increased advance is caused by the de-\ncrease in water intake rate in the previously wetted\narea and decreased furrow roughness. By alternating\nflows in furrows, the total advance time and volume of\nwater applied are both reduced when compared to\nstandard continuous flow methods. Generally, surging\nresults in more uniform water infiltration throughout\nthe length of the furrow. Figure 6–3 illustrates how\nsurge flow compares with conventional steady flow\nfurrow irrigation methods.\nIrrigation water can be surged manually to reduce the\nrequired advance time to the end of the field. These\nhigh labor systems are typically used on recently tilled\nsoils and on soils that crack when dry.\nSome irrigators use surge as a labor saving device,\noperating two irrigation sets with each water change.\nBecause half the water is applied to each irrigation set,\ntotal set time may need to increase to provide an\nadequate irrigation. Where overirrigation has occurred\nin the past, less water is applied at better uniformity\nwithin the same set time.\nOnce the advance phase is complete, surge valve time\ninterval can be set to provide a cutback irrigation\ninflow (short equal time intervals on each side). Some\nrefer to this action as a soak cycle. Typically runoff is\nreduced without sacrificing irrigation uniformity down\nthe furrow.\nThe system uses a battery powered, timer controlled\nvalve that controls the direction of the irrigation flow.\nThis is usually accomplished with a butterfly type\nvalve as illustrated in figure 6–4. Solar powered panels\nare available for battery charging. Programmable\ncontrollers are also available. The control valve alter-\nnately directs the irrigation head to flow in opposite\ndirections from the valve, usually in gated pipe. Modifi-\ncations have been adapted for use on open concrete\nlined ditches using gated ports.\nAdvantages:\n• Generally less water is used, distribution unifor-\nmity is increased, deep percolation at the upper\nend of the field is decreased, and overall applica-\ntion efficiency is increased.\n• Surging times can be easily adjusted when using\ntimer flow control valves.\n• Small application amounts can be applied.\n• Where water is pumped, energy use can be\nreduced.\n• Overall, deep percolation and runoff can be\nreduced.\n• One controller can be moved from site to site to\noperate additional valve bodies.\nLimitations:\n• Normal opening and closing of valves for surging\nis not practical for manual operation. However,\nmanually operated long surge cycles on cracking\nclay soils may be advantageous.\n• Care must be taken to assure adequate water is\nbeing applied, especially at the lower end of the\nfield.\n• Additional cost is associated with surge valve(s)\nand controller(s).\n• When surge equipment is used on clay and clay\nloam soils, careful management is necessary to\navoid excessive field runoff, especially if ad-\nequate water is applied to the plant root zone at\nthe lower end of the field.\nPlanning and design considerations:\nFor many soils, experience has been that the same\nstream size under surge flow advances to the end of\nthe field on both sets in nearly the same amount or\nless time it takes one conventional set in continuous\nflow. Flows advance to the end of twice as many\nfurrows with the same amount of water and time.\nSurge flows allow light irrigations to be applied more\nefficiently (for germination of new crops, for crops\nwith shallow root systems, and between rainfall events\nin semiarid climatic regions).\nMany existing gated pipe systems can be converted to\nsurge. Depending on existing outlets from a buried\npipe system (or from a head ditch), layout of gated\npipe for a surge system may be relatively easy. Per-\nhaps only surge valves are needed. Solar battery\npowered, time clock controlled, commercial valves are\nreadily available. Valve controllers that can be pro-\ngrammed in variable surge times during the advance",

They should also be program-\nmable for short duration surges after the water has\nreached the end of the furrow. This type of valve\nallows maximum flexibility in managing surge irriga-\ntion.\nSometimes costs and labor can be reduced by using\nseveral valve bodies with one controller. This allows\nleaving the valve bodies and gated pipe in place across\nthe field(s) during the season, or with an extra valve\nbody, the next irrigation set can be readied while the\nexisting set is in operation. Only one controller is\nmoved from place to place when each irrigation set is\nstarted.\nSurge flow irrigation requires a greater level of man-\nagement skill than conventional furrow irrigation.\nMost irrigators need assistance when first operating a\nsurge system. They need to be able to observe the\nprogress of each irrigation during different parts of the\nirrigation season as infiltration changes and to make\nthe appropriate adjustments in surge times and flow\nrates. Field observations and evaluations of each\nirrigation application can help in fine tuning surge\ncycling times. Adjustments to gates are necessary to\nmaintain uniform advance in all furrows. Screening of\nirrigation canal and reservoir water is necessary to\nlimit debris from partly plugging valves and gates in\ngated pipe. Constant and uniform flow from gate\nopenings is essential throughout the irrigation set.\nAlternative methods for providing proper on-times\ninclude:\n• Variable time-constant distance advance, vari-\nable cutback time method—This method varies\nthe times of surges advancing in the furrow and\nthe time of surges after water reaches the end of\nthe furrow. Time adjustments can often be made\nso water in the furrow never quite recedes during\na surge, yet runoff is kept very low.\n• Variable time-constant distance advance, con-\nstant cutback method—This method varies the\ntimes of surges advancing in the furrow and uses\na constant time for surges after water has\nreached the end of the furrow. This method may\nbe most beneficial with moderate to high intake\nsoils.\n• Constant time-variable distance method—This\nmethod is used when the surge controller cannot\nautomatically utilize variable surge times.\nWhen using any of these methods, the planning techni-\ncian and irrigator must realize that to apply the same\namount of water, the surge sets need to be allowed to\nrun longer than they previously ran to irrigate the\nsame area. This is true unless only a light application\nis desired, and is especially the case when irrigating\nlow intake soils.\nDesign procedures:\nDesign procedures and examples provided in section\n652.0605 are developed from state approved computer\nprograms using existing methodology from chapters 4\nand 5 of this guide, or from ARS publication Surface\nIrrigation Model, SRFR.\n(vii) \tGraded furrow using cablegation tech-\nnique—This modification to graded furrow irrigation\ncan potentially decrease runoff, increase uniformity of\ninfiltration, and decrease labor required. A plug in-\nserted inside a gated pipe at the head ditch location is\npushed slowly downslope through the pipe by water\npressure. As the plug moves past the gates, water\nflows out the gates. Furrow flow (gate discharge)\ngradually reduces until the free water surface in the\ngated pipeline is lower than the gate opening. The plug\nis restrained by a small cable or rope attached to a\nhydraulic or electric braking device located at the\nhead end of the gated pipe. The speed of the cable\ncontrols the time of set and depth of application.\nCablegation has some of the same benefits as cutback\nirrigation. Maximum furrow inflow occurs at the\nbeginning of irrigation as the moving plug clears the\nopened gate. Figure 6–5 illustrates the general arrange-\nment of controls, pipes, and outlets in a cablegation\nsystem. Large gates, or risers on a buried pipeline, can\nbe used to irrigate borders.\nAdvantages:\n• Reduces labor. The system is essentially an\nautomated gated pipe system.\n• Easy to adjust speed of plug (irrigation set time).\n• Improves distribution uniformity. Can reduce\nrunoff and deep percolation.\n• Variable grades along the gated pipe can be\naccounted for.\nLimitations:\n• Precise grade is required for gated pipe to\nachieve uniformity of gate discharge (furrow\ninflow).",

The pipe is sized large enough to\ncarry the head of water at the head ditch grade with-\nout completely filling the pipe (partial pipe flow). The\nplug causes water from the supply source to fill the\npipe and flow out the outlets. See figure 6–5.\nIn this figure, the outlets (a) nearest the plug have the\ngreatest pressure head; therefore, the greatest outflow.\nAs the plug moves down grade, the pressure head\ndecreases for any one gate causing the outflow to\ndecrease (b). This process continues until outflow\nceases because the outlet is above the water level in\nthe pipe (c).\nPartial pipe flow condition is essential for cablegation\nto function. Once gates are adjusted for the desirable\nfurrow flow, adjustments for following irrigations are\nseldom necessary.\nShortly after the plug reaches the end of the pipe and\nthe last furrow has been irrigated the desired amount\nof time, water is shut off and the plug is removed by\nremoving a cap on the end of the gated pipe.

The\nplug is reattached to the cable at the head of the pipe\nready for the next irrigation. Water brakes, hydraulic\nrams, or electrical winch devices control the speed of\nthe cable and plug. The water brake is a low cost, but\nvery effective, water powered device. See ARS publi-\ncation ARS-21, Cablegation Systems for Irrigation,\nfor details of speed control devices. Rewinding of the\ncable is generally done by hand.\nDesign procedures:\nDesign methodology is reviewed in ARS publication\nARS-21, Cablegation Systems for Irrigation, and\nseveral supplements published in recent years review-\ning current research. Design procedure and examples\nare presented in section 652.0605.\n(viii) \tGraded furrow with tailwater reuse\n(pumpback)—This modification to graded furrow\nirrigation can increase overall field application effi-\nciency since most of the runoff or tailwater is returned\nto the head of the same field or to a lower elevation\nfield for reuse. Furrow inflow rates are generally\nhigher for decreased advance times and improved\ndistribution uniformity. The components of a tailwater\nreuse (pumpback) facility includes tailwater collection\nditches, a pumping plant with sump, pipeline(s), and a\nholding pond at either the lower end or the head end\nof a field or farm.\nAdvantages:\n• Offsite runoff is decreased, thereby decreasing\npotential pollution of other surface water.\n• Wastewater is available for irrigation or other on-\nfarm uses.\n• Better utilization of water delivered to the farm.\n• Furrow irrigation application uniformity is in-\ncreased.\n• Soluble chemicals contained in tailwater are\nreapplied to cropland.\nLimitations:\n• Irrigated cropland is often taken out of produc-\ntion for the reservoir or sump. Many times ponds\ncan be located in odd shaped corners that are not\nfarmed.\n• Flow to downstream users depending on runoff\nis reduced.\n• Depending on chemical application and manage-\nment, runoff can contain high levels of nutrients\nand pesticides. This can create a potential hazard\nto wildlife, especially water fowl that are drawn\nto ponded water.\nPlanning and design considerations:\nItems to consider for this type of system are topogra-\nphy and layout of irrigated fields and the irrigators\nmanagement level and desire. Figure 6–6 displays a\ntypical tailwater recovery and reuse system in con-\njunction with an underground distribution pipeline.\nWhere the holding pond is located at the head end of\nthe field or farm, only a small pumping plant and\npump sump are required at the lower end. This alter-\nnative allows the pumping of tailwater as it occurs.\nThe peak flow used to size the pump is generally less\nthan half of the irrigation inflow, and a smaller diam-\neter pipe is needed. The pump can be cycled or have\nfloat control switches that automatically turn on and\nturn off the pump as runoff collects in the sump, or it\ncan be set to run continuously during the runoff\nperiod. Regardless where the holding pond is located,\nit should have the capacity to store runoff from one\ncomplete irrigation set.\nWhere siphon tubes, spiles, or ditch turnouts are used,\ncutback irrigation can result when water is returned to\nthe supply ditch only during the first half of the irrigation\nset. While pumping back to the presently used head\nditch, the water surface in the head ditch raises, causing\nsiphon tube, spile, or turnout discharge to increase. This\nis generally undesirable. Where storage is inadequate,\nadditional furrows must be set to use the pumpback\nwater. Where gated pipe is used, pumpback flows are\ngenerally uniform and constant during the irrigation set.\nAdditional gates are opened to discharge the pumpback\nwater. To reduce labor and odd irrigation set times, it is\ntypically easier to use the pumpback water on new sets.\nHowever, storage to contain runoff from one complete\nirrigation is necessary.\nWhere erosion is present, a small, shallow sediment\nsettling basin should be installed just upstream of the\nsump pump or inlet end of the holding pond. A shallow\nbasin can be cleaned relatively easily with available\nfarm machinery, while a large pond or pit may require\ncleaning with large construction type equipment.",

Irrigation tailwater should enter the\nsump or pond in a protected inlet structure (i.e., pipe\ndrop inlet) at or near the pump inlet. Suspended silts\nand clays are then pumped back onto the field.\nTailwater collection ditches excavated below furrow\noutlet grade are the major cause of erosion when\nfurrow irrigating highly erosive soils. Furrow outflow\nis often allowed to drop several inches into the\ntailwater collection ditches. An erosion headfall devel-\nops and works its way upstream in the furrow. This\ncondition effectively removes soil and carries it into\nthe tailwater collection ditch. Narrow vegetative strips\n(10 to 15 feet wide) and hand placed straw in the\nfurrows just upstream of the tailwater collection ditch\nare effective means to control this type of erosion.\nBuried pipelines with risers at furrow grade can also\nbe used.\nMany pumps are available for use in tailwater recovery\nfacilities. Tailwater runoff can contain suspended\nsediment, plant debris, worms, insects, and farm\nchemicals. Either sufficient screening is required to\nkeep the material out of the pump, or a pump is se-\nlected that can handle the material. Pumping heads are\ngenerally low; therefore, horsepower requirements are\ngenerally low. Electric power is preferred to drive\npumps because tractor and diesel engines are typically\noverpowered. However, for limited use a farm tractor\nmay be desirable.\nTailwater reuse facility design requires reasonable\nestimates of runoff rate and volume. A field evaluation\ncan be provided for an irrigation event to estimate the\nrunoff, or runoff can be measured. A field evaluation\nor tailwater flow measurement should be made during\nperiods of maximum expected tailwater runoff (i.e.,\nsecond irrigation after furrows are smoothed by previ-\nous irrigation and before maximum crop water use).\nFigure 6–6 \tTypical layout for a tailwater recovery and reuse facility\nRes.\nReturn\npipeline\nCollector\nditch",

Losses\ncan be as high as 25 to 35 percent of the runoff volume\ndepending on the many variables and management\nskills of the irrigator.\nDesign procedures:\nSee Chapter 7, Farm Distribution Components, for\nadditional discussion, design procedures, and examples.\n(g) Contour ditch\nContour ditch is a form of controlled surface flooding.\nThis system consists of installing a series of irrigation\nditches or gated pipe running across the slope on the\ncontour with little grade (< 0.1 ft per 100 ft). Water is\ndischarged with siphon tubes, from gated pipe, or\nallowed to flow over the banks of the contour ditch\nuniformly along the length of the irrigation set. Gener-\nally, no flow constraints, such as dikes or levees, are\nalong the length of run. In theory the water moves\ndown the slope as a uniform sheet, but in practice it\ngenerally does not. The flow mostly moves to low\nareas and becomes nonuniformly distributed. Runoff\nis collected in the next downslope contour ditch and\nredistributed. Pasture and hay are the crops typically\ngrown. Corrugations can be used to help irrigation\nflows.\nThe spacing between the ditches is governed by topog-\nraphy, soil intake rate, and net irrigation application.\nThis type system is applicable to slopes up to 15 per-\ncent. On slopes of more than 2 percent, it should be\nrestricted to sod forming crops. This system is adapt-\nable to the steep residual soils in foothill areas and is\ngenerally used where season long water is not avail-\nable at a reasonable cost.\n(1) Advantages\n• Contour ditch is low in establishment costs,\nrequiring very little field preparation. However,\nland leveling or grading between the ditches can\nimprove the uniform distribution of water.\n• Irrigation efficiencies can be reasonable (50 to\n60%) where soils are underlain by impermeable\nlayers and where diligence is practiced for reuse\nof runoff.\n• Flow onto fields from contour ditches can be\nsemi-automated by use of continuously moving\nportable dams. The ditch generally must be well\nsodded since flow is typically over the bank. This\nworks well with permanent crops, such as al-\nfalfa, clover, and pasture.\n(2) Limitations\n• High labor requirement until system is fully\nestablished, then labor can be low.\n• Should not be used on highly erodible soils\nunless stabilized by permanent sod type crop. It\nis recommended crop establishment be done\nwith a temporary sprinkler system.\n• Open ditch maintenance is high.\n(3) Planning and design considerations\nThe most frequently encountered problem with con-\ntour ditch irrigation is maintaining adequate water\nspread throughout the length of run. The more uni-\nform the field slope, the more uniform the irrigation\nflow is across the irrigation set. Corrugations installed\ndown the principal grade are often used to help main-\ntain uniform distribution.\nContour ditch systems are generally designed from\nlocal experience. The planning technician must follow\nup with the irrigator to assist in making adjustments as\nnecessary to improve distribution uniformity. Table\n6–2 provides estimates of design efficiencies. Under\nbest site and management conditions, overall applica-\ntion efficiencies of 35 to 60 percent are possible.\nTypically, efficiency is in the range of 25 to 50 percent.\nCollection of runoff and redistribution is necessary to\nobtain these levels. See table 6–3 for general guide-\nlines for recommended maximum length of run using a\nunit width stream of 0.01 cubic foot per second per\nfoot.\n(4) Design procedures\nDesigns for contour ditch irrigation systems are diffi-\ncult because the ground surface, slopes, and lengths of\nrun vary. Only rough approximations can be made,\nand adjustments after initial irrigations are necessary.\nBasic surface irrigation system design principles and\nfield experience have been used to develop design\ntables and computer programs. See section 652.0605\nfor design tables, procedures, and examples.",

Even soils that have flatter slopes can have\nerosion problems. Maximum allowable furrow flow is,\nin most part, determined by the amount of erosion that\nmay occur. Soils may erode if the furrow velocity\nexceeds about 0.5 feet per second. Figure 5–13 in NEH\nPart 623 (Section 15), Chapter 5, Furrow Irrigation,\nshows velocity and depth of flow for various stream\nsizes and grades in a standard shaped furrow. Recom-\nmended maximum allowable stream sizes are:\nQ = 15 / S \terosion resistant soils\nQ = 12.5 / S \taverage soils\nQ = 10 / S \tmoderately erodible soils\nQ = 5 / S \thighly erodible soils (This value can\nrange from 3 to 9, depending on\nerodibility of soils.)\nwhere:\nQ = gpm per furrow\nS = slope in percent\nA practical upper limit for inflow rate is about 50\ngallons per minute, regardless of furrow slope.\nStreams larger than 50 gallons per minute generally\nrequire a much larger furrow cross section, or furrow\nridge inundation occurs.\nSampling the amount of sediment coming off a field\nbeing planned for irrigation, or one similar to the one\nbeing planned, is the best way to determine degree of\nerosion. Close observations must be made along the\nentire furrow length to see where erosion is actually\noccurring and where sediment deposition is occurring.\nErosion and sediment deposition throughout the\nlength of the furrow is a dynamic process. Typically,\nmost erosion occurs within the first few feet of furrow\nlength or in the last few feet of the furrow. The pri-\nmary cause is high velocities from head ditch outlets\n(gated pipe, siphon tubes, spiles, etc.) or excess\ndropoff at end of furrow into tailwater collection\nditches.\nAn Imhoff cone may be used to evaluate furrow sedi-\nment discharge. Flow at any point in the furrow length\ncan be used, but the sample is generally taken at the\noutflow point. A 1 liter sample is taken, placed in the\nImhoff cone and allowed to settle for 30 minutes\n(Trout 1994). The sediment level in the cone is read\ndirectly in ml/L. Conversion from volume to weight is\nnecessary. This conversion can be estimated at 1 gram\n= 1 mL, or can be determined by calibration using\nlocal soils. Furrow outflow rate throughout the irriga-\ntion, furrow length and spacing must be known to\nestimate sediment yield in tons per acre for that spe-\ncific field condition. Many tests are required with fully\ncontrolled conditions before collected data can be\naccurately expanded to other conditions, such as other\nsoils, slopes, residue amounts, and furrow flow,\nlength, shape, and roughness.\nThe planning technician can suggest several alterna-\ntives to the water user for reducing furrow erosion to\nacceptable levels. For example, conversion to a low\napplication rate sprinkler system may be necessary to\nreduce erosion to desirable levels. With highly erosive\nsoils, furrow irrigation can be difficult to manage in a\nmanner that allows water to be applied uniformly and\nefficiently and yet have minimal erosion. High levels of\nwater management and residue intensive cultural\npractices are generally required when surface irrigat-\ning highly erosive soils on field slopes of more than 1\npercent.\nSome methods and practices that can reduce field\nerosion and sediment deposition in tailwater collec-\ntion facilities and surface water bodies are:\nImprove water application—Change inflow rate,\nchange time of set, or use surge technique. All param-\neters must be evaluated so as to not increase deep\npercolation losses in the upper part of the field. An\nincrease in deep percolation can mean increased\npotential for ground water pollution.\nModify existing system—Shorten length of run or\nreduce irrigation grades with corresponding changes\nof furrow inflow rate.\nConvert to another irrigation method (or sys-\ntem)—Change system to a low application rate sprin-\nkler or micro irrigation system.\nChange cropping sequence or crops—Use higher\nresidue producing crops.\nChange tillage systems, reduce tillage opera-\ntions, or change tillage equipment—Use reduced\ntillage or no-till cultural practices to maintain higher\nrates of residue on the soil surface.",

Sprinkler irrigation sys-\ntems are classed by operation of the laterals. The three\nmain types of sprinkle systems (laterals) are fixed,\nperiodic move, and continuous/self move.\nSprinkler irrigation system examples include solid set\n(portable and permanent), handmove laterals, side roll\n(wheel-line) laterals, end tow laterals, hose fed (pull)\nlaterals, perforated pipe laterals, high and low pres-\nsure center pivots and linear (lateral) move laterals,\nand stationary or traveling gun sprinklers and booms.\nLow Energy Precision Application (LEPA), and Low\nPressure In Canopy (LPIC), systems are included with\nsprinkler systems as an operational modification to\ncenter pivot and linear move systems.\nPressure for sprinkler systems is generally provided by\npumping, powered by electric motors and diesel,\nnatural gas, L P gas, or gasoline engines. Where suffi-\ncient elevation drop is available, sprinkler systems can\nbe operated using gravity to provide the necessary\noperating pressure.\nIf the system is properly designed and operated, appli-\ncation efficiencies of 50 to 95 percent can be obtained.\nThe efficiency depends on type of system, cultural\npractices, and management. Poor management (i.e.,\nirrigating too soon or applying too much water) is the\ngreatest cause of reduced water application efficiency\nwhen using sprinklers. System losses are caused by:\n• Direct evaporation in the air from the sprinkler\nspray, from the soil surface, and from plant\nleaves that intercept spray water.\n• Wind drift (normally 5 to 10 percent depending\non temperature, wind speed, and droplet size).\n• Leaks and system drainage.\n• Surface runoff and deep percolation resulting\nfrom, nonuniform application within the sprin-\nkler pattern. If the system is designed to apply\nwater at less than the maximum soil infiltration\nrate, no runoff losses will occur. With some\nsystems where water is applied below or within\nthe crop canopy, wind drift and most evapora-\ntion losses are reduced. Soil surface storage is\nespecially important where low pressure in-\ncanopy center pivot laterals are used. LEPA\nsystems use complete soil, water, and plant\nmanagement to prevent runoff.\nThe water infiltration process under sprinkler irriga-\ntion differs from that in surface irrigation. With sur-\nface methods, water is ponded on the surface. With\nsprinkle irrigation, water is applied so ponding does\nnot occur or is only temporary. System application\nrate should be less than the maximum allowable rates\nshown in Chapter 2, Soils, unless soil surface storage\n(ponding) can be assured without appreciable translo-\ncation of applied water.\nOn sloping sites where the soils have a low to medium\nintake rate, runoff often occurs under center pivot\nsystems, especially at the outer end of the sprinkler\nlateral. Developing surface storage with reservoir\ntillage, rough tillage, and residue management prac-\ntices or temporarily increasing intake rate with ripping\nbetween plant rows helps control water translocation.\nPlanning and design considerations and guidelines for\nselection of sprinkler irrigation equipment presented\nlater is not all inclusive. Refer to NEH, Part 623, (Sec-\ntion 15), Chapter 11, Sprinkle Irrigation, for further\ndetails. Operating pressures for these guidelines are\ngrouped as follows:\nPressure \tlb/in2\nLow \t2 to 35\nModerate \t35 to 50\nMedium \t50 to 75\nHigh \t75+\nThe range of single event application efficiency (Ea)\nvalues for various types of sprinkle systems are dis-\nplayed in table 6–4. Season long irrigation application\nefficiencies typically are lower because of early season\nplant water requirements and soil intake rate changes.\nSoil characteristics relating to irrigation are provided\nin Chapter 2, Soils. Crop characteristics relating to\nirrigation are provided in Chapter 3, Crops, and irriga-\ntion water requirements are provided in Chapter 4,\nWater Requirements.",

See NEH, Part 623,\nChapter 2, Irrigation Water Requirements, for further\ndetails regarding crop water needs. The required capac-\nity of a sprinkle system can be computed by:\nQ A d\nf T\n= 453 or \tQ A d\nT\n= ′\t453\nwhere:\nQ = system capacity (gpm)\nA = area irrigated (acres)\nd = gross depth of application (inches)\nf \t= time allowed for completion of one irrigation\n(days)\nT = actual operating time per day (hours per day) to\ncover entire area\nd′ = gross daily water use rate (inches per day)—\nmay be peak or average, depending on need and\nrisks to be taken.\nNote: This equation represents the basic irrigation\nequation QT = DA with conversion factors for sprin-\nkler irrigation design. Typically, tables readily avail-\nable by NRCS and manufacturers pertaining to sprin-\nkler heads, pipe friction losses, and pump curves are\nin units of gallons per minute (gpm) rather than cubic\nfeet per second, cubic meters per second, or liters per\nminute.\nTable 6–4 \tApplication efficiencies for various sprinkler\nsystems\nType \tE a (%)\nPeriodic move lateral \t60 – 75\nPeriodic move gun type or boom sprinklers \t50 – 60\nFixed laterals (solid set) \t60 – 75\nTraveling sprinklers (gun type or boom) \t55 – 65\nCenter pivot - standard \t75 – 85\nLinear (lateral) move \t80 – 87\nLEPA - center pivot and linear move \t90 – 95\n(b) Periodic move sprinkler\nirrigation systems\nA periodic move sprinkler irrigation system is set in a\nfixed location for a specified length of time to apply a\nrequired depth of water. The length of time in a posi-\ntion is called the length of set or irrigation set time.\nThe lateral or sprinkler is then moved to the next set\nposition. Application efficiencies can range from 50 to\n75 percent for the low quarter area of the field (E q).\nThe low quarter area definition commonly applies to\nall periodic move or set type sprinkler systems.\n(1) Periodic move systems\n(i) Handmove laterals—This system is composed\nof portable pipelines with risers and sprinkler heads.\nPortable or buried mainline pipe with uniformly\nspaced valve outlets provides a water supply. Portable\naluminum, or sometimes plastic, lateral pipe has quick\ncouplers. Risers and sprinkler heads are either center-\nmounted or end-mounted. Lateral sections are typi-\ncally 20, 30, or 40 feet long. When the lateral has com-\npleted the last set location in the field, it must be\ndismantled and moved back across the field to the\nstart position unless multiple laterals are used and the\nfinish location is adjacent to the start location of the\nnext set. Application efficiencies can be 60 to 75\npercent with proper management.\nA handmove system has a low initial cost, but requires\nhigh operating labor. It is difficult to use in tall crops,\nsuch as corn or mature vineyards. Riser height must be\nbased on maximum height of the crop to be grown.\nFor hydraulic reasons minimum height is generally 6\ninches. Risers over 4 feet in height must be anchored\nand stabilized. Handmove systems are sometimes\nused to establish a crop that will later be irrigated by\na surface system. Leaching salts and other toxic ions\nfrom soils is sometimes accomplished using\nhandmove sprinklers. Handmove sprinklers are easily\nadapted to odd shaped fields. Because 3-inch diam-\neter laterals are easier to pick up by hand and carry to\nthe next set, they are much preferred over those that\nare 4 inches in diameter. However, long laterals\nshould be 4 inches in diameter. Because of excessive\nbending while being carried, 40 foot lengths of 2-inch\ndiameter pipe are unsuitable.",

The lateral pipe\nserves as an axle to assist in moving the system side-\nways by rotation to the next set. The sections of the\nlateral pipe are semi-permanently bolted together.\nEach pipe section is supported by a large diameter (at\nleast 3 ft) wheel generally located at the center, but\ncan be at the end. The lateral pipe itself forms the axle\nfor the wheels. The lateral is moved mechanically by a\npower unit (air-cooled gas engine) generally mounted\nat the center of the line. With proper management,\napplication efficiencies can be 60 to 75 percent.\nThe side roll system can be used only on low growing\ncrops, such as grass pasture, grain, grain sorghum,\nalfalfa, sugar beets, potatoes, and vegetables. The\nsystem is best adapted to rectangular fields on rela-\ntively uniform topography. A flexible hose or telescop-\ning section of pipe is required at the beginning of each\nlateral to connect onto mainline outlet valves.\nWheel diameters should be selected so that the lateral\nclears the crop. Specified lateral move distance is\nequal to the distance moved by a whole number of\nrotations of the line. Commonly used nominal wheel\ndiameters are about 5, 6, and 7 feet. Wheels as large as\n10-foot diameter are sometimes used to clean taller\ncrops or to allow wheel lines to be moved across\nfurrows and ridges.\nSelf-righting or vertical self-aligning sprinkler heads\nare used because the sprinkler head is always upright,\neven with partial rotations. Without the self aligning\nheads, extra care must be taken so that the pipe rota-\ntion is fully complete for the full length of the lateral\nand all sprinkler heads are upright. The ends of the\nlateral usually trail a little and must be moved by hand\nfor proper alignment, or the lateral can be moved just\npast the set position and then backed up to align the\nends properly. Poor distribution uniformity results if\nthe sprinkler heads are not upright. Undulating topog-\nraphy usually requires alignment by hand for best\nuniformity.\nSide roll lateral pipe diameters of 4 or 5 inches are\nmost common. Common sprinkler head spacing is 30\nor 40 feet. Laterals can be up to 1,600 feet long with\none power unit. Lateral lengths of 1,320 feet are gener-\nally considered maximum for rough, steep, or undulat-\ning topography. Figure 6–7 displays a typical side roll\nor handmove system operation layout.\nQuick-drain valves are installed at several locations on\neach lateral to assist line drainage before it is moved.\nThe lateral moves much easier when it is empty. Drain\nvalves are a factor in the minimum operating pressure\nthat must be used on the lateral. Typically drains will\nnot close and seal properly below about 24 pounds per\nsquare inch. Drain valves should be well maintained to\nprovide proper closing upon filling the lateral line to\nstart the next irrigation set.\nEmpty laterals must be anchored to prevent move-\nment by wind. They roll very easily and should be\nproperly restrained, especially during the nonirrigation\nseason when the irrigator spends little time in the\nfield.\nA variation to the side roll lateral (called side move) is\nthe addition of small diameter trail lines at each sprin-\nkler head location. These trail lines can have three,\nfour, or five sprinkler heads, and the complete unit can\nbe an equivalent of two or three typical laterals. With\nthis modification, the lateral pipe cannot serve as the\naxle when being moved because trail lines are at-\ntached directly to the lateral pipe. A separate drive\nshaft and the main sprinkler lateral are supported by\nan A-frame at each wheel location. The A-frame is\nsupported by two wheels.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation System Design\tChapter 6\n6–30 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nThis variation requires dismantling of the trail lines\nwhen the lateral has reached the end set, where trail\nlines are hauled back to the start location. The main\nsprinkler lateral is typically moved back to the start\nlocation by a centrally located power unit, usually an\nair-cooled gas engine.\n(iii) End-tow laterals—The end-tow lateral system\nis similar to a hand move system except that it con-\nsists of rigidly coupled lateral pipe and is mounted on\nskid plates or dolly wheels. The mainline is buried\nacross the middle of the field. Laterals are towed\nlengthwise across the mainline from one side to the\nother with a tractor. Both ends of the lateral can be\nconnected to the mainline via a flexible hose. After\ndraining the pipe through quick-drain valves, a small\ntractor can easily tow a quarter-mile-long line to its\nnew set.\nTwo support or carriage types are available. One is a\nskid plate attached to each coupler to slightly raise the\nlateral pipe off the ground, protect the drain valve, and\nprovide a wear surface when towing the pipe. Out-\nriggers are placed every 200 to 300 feet to prevent\noverturning. The other carriage type uses small metal\nwheels located midway between couplers to allow\neasy towing. Guide rollers are used near the mainline\nto position the lateral at the next set. Typically lateral\npositions are offset a half of the total move. Applica-\ntion efficiencies can be 60 to 75 percent with proper\nmanagement.\nThis system is best suited to grass pasture, but can be\nused in row crops if unplanted tow paths are main-\ntained. It requires a fairly large area adjacent to the\nmainline to allow positioning of the lateral to the next\nset on the opposite side of the mainline. When used\nwith row crops, this area can be planted to grass or\nalfalfa. The advantage of this system is its relatively\nlow cost and minimum labor requirement.\n(iv) Hose fed (pull) laterals—A variation to end-\ntow laterals is the hose fed system. A few (typically\none to five) low capacity sprinkler heads are mounted\non small diameter flexible plastic or rubber hoses that\nare attached to outlet valves. The hoses with equally\nspaced sprinklers are pulled by hand to the next\nadjacent set. To utilize small, light weight flexible hose\nthat can be easily moved by hand, submains are used.\nThe number of sprinkler heads, thus the length of\nlaterals, is limited by both high friction loss in the\nsmall diameter hose and the ease of moving. This\nsystem is excellent for orchards and irregular shaped\nfields where the number of sprinklers per hose can\nvary in proportion to the field or set width to be cov-\nered. With proper management, application efficien-\ncies can be 50 to 65 percent.\n(v) Gun type sprinkler—Large, periodic move, gun\ntype sprinklers are operated and moved as a large\nsingle impact type sprinkler head. Sprinkler discharge\nflows can range from 50 to more than 1,000 gallons per\nminute. Nozzle diameters can vary from 1/2 to 1 3/4\ninches, and operating pressures from 60 to more than\n120 pounds per square inch. The sprinkler is moved\nfrom one set to the next set either by hand or using a\nsmall tractor, depending on their size and whether\nthey are towable. Generally only one sprinkler is\noperated per lateral. Laterals are generally aluminum\npipe with quick-coupled joints.\nWhen irrigating, the sprinkler is allowed to remain at\none location (set) until the desired amount of water is\napplied. Application rates can be very high, and unifor-\nmity of application can be adversely effected with\nwind greater than 4 miles per hour. Droplet size will be\nlarge beyond 50 feet from the sprinkler, thus soil\npuddling can occur and sensitive crops can be dam-\naged. With proper management, application efficien-\ncies can be 50 to 60 percent.\n(vi) Boom sprinkler—Periodic move boom systems\nare operated and moved with a tractor similar to large\ngun sprinklers. The boom generally contains several\nclosely spaced impact sprinklers or spray heads. It\nrotates around a central swivel joint where water is\nintroduced. Power for the rotation comes from back\npressure caused by directional sprinkler nozzles. The\nsupply line is generally portable aluminum with quick-\ncoupled joints. When irrigating, the boom is allowed to\nremain at one location (set) until the desired amount\nof water is applied.\nBoom sprinkle systems are not suitable for use in\nwindy areas. Wind adversely affects uniformity of\napplication and rotational operation. High winds can\noverturn the entire boom. With proper management,\napplication efficiencies can be 50 to 60 percent.",

The holes are sized and spaced to apply\nwater uniformly along the length of the lateral. Com-\nmon operating pressures are 5 to 20 pounds per square\ninch. Application rates close to the lateral are gener-\nally quite high. Spacing between lateral sets must be\nquite close to obtain an acceptable uniformity of\napplication. Either plastic or aluminum laterals with\nquick-coupled joints are used. Water used must be free\nof debris, otherwise hole plugging is a problem. With\nproper management, application efficiencies can be\naround 50 percent.\n(2) Planning and design considerations\n(i) Sprinkler heads—Rotating, impact type sprin-\nkler heads operating at intermediate pressure (30 to 60\nlb/in 2) are commonly used on periodic move lateral\ntype systems. Rotating impact sprinkler heads come\nwith many variations including full circle, part circle,\nlow and standard trajectory height, with and without\nstraightening vanes, and single or double nozzle. The\nsecond nozzle on a double nozzle head is typically a 3/\n32- or 1/8-inch diameter orifice. It is used as a fill-in to\nimprove pattern uniformity.\nFlow control valves at the base of each sprinkler head\nor flow control nozzles may be required where the\nterrain undulates or has significant changes in eleva-\ntion. Flow control nozzles require about 2 to 4 pounds\nper square inch. Impact type sprinkler heads can be\noperated at 25 to 35 pounds per square inch to reduce\nenergy. Some systems operate on gravity pressure.\n(ii) Laterals—Laterals are generally laid out per-\npendicular to the slope. To obtain near-uniform appli-\ncation of water throughout the length of lateral, pipe\ndiameter and length should result in discharge at the\nsprinkler nozzle within plus or minus 10 percent of\ndesign. (A maximum nozzle pressure difference of 20\npercent provides a discharge not varying more than 10\npercent from each nozzle.) To create less confusion\nand to facilitate dismantling, moving, and stacking, the\nsame sprinkler head, nozzle size, and diameter of\nlateral are recommended throughout the length of\nhand move laterals. Convenient set times are 23.5,\n11.5, or 7.5 hours, thus allowing a half hour for drain-\ning and moving laterals, with one, two, or three moves\nper day. Moving the lateral three times a day is not\npopular because one move always comes in the dark\nat a inconvenient time and with increased labor cost.\n(iii) Lateral set sequencing—Lateral sets can be\nsequenced in several ways. Using a typical 40 by 50\nfoot spacing for a periodic move lateral system, the\nfollowing methods can be used to move laterals across\na field.\nMove at 50-foot sets across the field. Portable laterals\nmust be dismantled and hauled back to the first set\nposition. Side roll laterals must be rolled all the way\nback to the first or initial set position. The irrigator\nmay choose to apply half the irrigation application in\neach direction. However, this requires twice the num-\nber of moves. Distribution uniformity is reasonable\nunder conditions where moderate pressure is used and\nwind is not a serious problem.\nMove at 100-foot sets across the field. Then reverse\ndirection and move back at alternating 100 foot sets.\nThis allows convenient operation of the system without\nhaving to dismantle and haul back or move the lateral to\nthe initial or start position. Distribution uniformity\ndepends on wind conditions. Lateral pipes are hand\ncarried twice as far as in the first method, but the lateral\ndoes not need to be dismantled and hauled back.\nUse 25-foot offset pipe when moving across the field\nthe second time and each alternating set thereafter,\nwith both the 50-foot and 100-foot set methods. This\nprocedure improves overall distribution uniformity\nespecially in windy areas. Existing 50-foot systems can\nbe easily converted by adding a 20- to 30-foot swing or\noffset line. (Slight realignment of the lateral is needed\nto evenly divide the set.)\nWith any set sequence, alternating day-night set with\neach rotation across the field is recommended. Crop\nevapotranspiration or winds generally are different\nduring daytime and nighttime hours causing varying\nlosses. Nighttime application is generally more effi-\ncient with better distribution uniformity. As much as\n10 percent more net application is accomplished with\nnight time sets. Sometimes 11-hour night sets and 13-\nhour day sets are used to overcome the difference.",

For example, if a valve was selected to\nmaintain about 30 pounds per square inch at the\nsprinkler, a pressure loss of about 4 pounds per square\ninch can be expected across the regulator and must be\naccounted for.\n(iii) Preliminary estimate of sprinkler spacing\nand sprinkler sizes—NEH, part 623 (section 15)\nchapter 11, tables 11–9 to 11–12 can be used to make a\npreliminary estimate of sprinkler spacing, nozzle size,\nand operating pressure. Many design slide rules and\ncomputer programs are available from sprinkler equip-\nment manufacturers. The slide rules are convenient for\ndeveloping preliminary design trials and for estimating\npurposes. A preliminary estimate of overall irrigation\napplication efficiency is required. Experience in an\narea and personally doing several designs and field\nevaluations help provide confidence in planning and\ndesigning.\n(4) Design procedures\nA step-by-step procedure for planning and designing a\nsprinkler irrigation system includes:\nStep 1—Identify resource concerns and problems.\nDetermine objective(s) and purpose of new or revised\nirrigation system. Include soil, water, air, plant, and\nanimal resources, and human considerations.\nStep 2—Inventory resources for field or farm. Include\narea irrigated, soil(s), topography, water source, and\nwhen available, water quantity and quality, power type\nand location, crops, irrigator's desire for a type of\nsprinkler system and timeframe for moving laterals,\nlabor availability, availability of sprinkler irrigation\nequipment dealers, and water management skill and\ndesire of the irrigation decisionmaker.\nStep 3—Determine soil characteristics and limita-\ntions. Include AWC, maximum allowable application\nrate, usable rooting depth, acidity, salinity, and water\ntable. Typical (actual) crop rooting depth needs to be\nidentified for specific fields and soils. In most soils,\nactual depth (and pattern) is less than usable rooting\ndepth because of farm management decisions (i.e.,\ntiming of field operations) and type of field equipment\nused. A field investigation is strongly recommended in\naddition to data in the local NRCS FOTG. If a field\ncontains more than one soil, the most restrictive soil\nmust be determined. Crops use essentially the same\namount of water whether growing in sand or clay soil.\nThus, the system should be managed to meet the\nneeds of the more restrictive soil.\nStep 4—Determine net irrigation water requirements\nfor crops to be grown. Use season, month, and peak or\naverage daily use rate, accounting for expected rainfall\nand acceptable risks.\nStep 5—Determine irrigation frequency, net applica-\ntion, gross application (based on estimated application\nefficiency), and minimum system capacity require-\nments.\nStep 6—Determine alternative irrigation systems\nsuitable to the site. Include the sprinkler system de-\nsired by the user. Evaluate alternative irrigation sys-\ntems and their multiresource impacts on the environ-\nment (soil, water, air, plant, animal, and human con-\nsiderations) with user.\nStep 7—Provide preliminary sprinkler head design.\nInclude spacing, discharge, operating pressure, wetted\ndiameter, head type, nozzle size(s), average applica-\ntion rate, and performance characteristics.\nStep 8—Determine number of laterals needed for\nselected time of set, set spacing, moves per day, and\nfrequency of irrigation in days.",

Does it meet the objective\nand purpose(s) identified in step 1?\nStep 10—Make adjustments as needed. This process\nmay need to be done more than once so the system fits\nthe field, soils, crops, water supply, environmental\nconcerns, and the desires of the irrigation decision-\nmaker.\nStep 11—Finalize sprinkler irrigation system design,\nlayout, and management skills required by the irriga-\ntion decisionmaker.\nStep 12—Determine lateral size(s) based on number\nof heads, flow rate, pipeline length, and allowable\npressure loss differential between first and last sprin-\nkler head. Determine if pressure or flow regulators are\nneeded. Determine minimum operating pressure\nrequired in mainline(s) at various critical locations on\nthe terrain. Several trial lateral locations may need to\nbe evaluated to determine the range of friction loss\nand consequent pressure required at various locations\nalong the mainline.\nStep 13—Determine mainline sizes required to meet\npressure and flow requirements according to number\nof operating laterals. This includes diameter, pipe\nmaterial, mainline location, and the location and type\nof valves and fittings. It involves hydraulic calcula-\ntions, basic cost-benefit relationships, and potential\npressure surge evaluations for pipe sizes and velocities\nselected. Mainline operating pressure measured at the\ndischarge side of each lateral outlet valve should be\nwithin 10 percent of the design lateral operating pres-\nsure. Where chemigation is anticipated, less operating\npressure difference is desirable. A graphic solution can\nbe helpful when sizing main supply pipelines. The\nground line and pipe hydraulic grade line (HGL) along\nthe mainline can be plotted for easy identification of\ncritical pressure locations. The distance between the\nground line and HGL will be the operating pressure at\nthat main line location.\nStep 14—Determine maximum and minimum Total\nDynamic Head (TDH) required for critical lateral\nlocation conditions. Determine total accumulated\nfriction loss in mainline, elevation rise (drop) from\npump to extreme point in the fields, water surface to\nground surface (lift) at pump, column loss with verti-\ncal turbine pumps, and miscellaneous losses (fittings,\nvalves, elbows) at the pump and throughout the sys-\ntem. It is wrong to assume miscellaneous losses are\nminor and to gloss over them. Type and size of valves,\nradii of elbows, and sharpness of fittings are impor-\ntant. Check them out and know how they affect sys-\ntem performance. See section 652.0605 for nomo-\ngraphs and tables used to estimate head losses.\nStep 15—Determine maximum and minimum pump-\ning plant capacity using required flow rate and TDH.\nEstimate brake horsepower for the motor or engine to\nbe used.\nStep 16—Preselect several alternative pumps avail-\nable from various dealers in the area. Use pump per-\nformance curves prepared for each make and model of\npump. Every pump has a different set of performance\n(characteristic) curves relating to operating head\n(pressure) output and discharge capacity. Select\npump(s) and power unit(s) for maximum operating\nefficiency within the full range of expected operating\nconditions. Multiple pumps may be desirable to effi-\nciently meet both minimum and maximum conditions.\nPump and drive unit alternatives are recommended as\na reference for determining availability. Only pump\ncapacity and TDH requirements are recommended to\nbe provided to the user. Never select a pump based on\nhorsepower alone. Let a pump dealer select the appro-\npriate motor or engine and pump to fit the conditions.\nAvailability of a pump dealer for providing mainte-\nnance and repair should be considered by the opera-\ntor. Buying a used pump without first checking pump\ncharacteristic curves for that specific pump is seldom\nsatisfactory. A pump needs to match the required\ncapacity and TDH for efficient and economic perfor-\nmance. An inefficient operating pump can use need-\nless excess energy.",

Laterals can be either permanently\nburied or portable pipe laid on the ground surface. To\nirrigate the field, one or more blocks (sections) of\nsprinklers are cycled on and off with a control valve at\nthe mainline. Opening and closing of valves can be\nmanual, programmed electronically, or timer clock\ncontrolled. A solid set sprinkler system can be easily\nautomated. Application efficiencies can be 60 to 85\npercent depending on design and management.\nIn addition to applying irrigation water, these systems\nare used to apply water for environmental control,\nsuch as frost protection, crop cooling, humidity con-\ntrol, bud delay, crop quality improvement, dust con-\ntrol, and chemical application. See NEH, Part 623,\nChapter 2, Irrigation Water Requirements, and section\n652.0605, State supplement, for detailed discussion of\nauxiliary water use.\n(1) Planning and design considerations\nSolid set portable laterals—Solid set portable\nlateral systems are generally used for high value crops,\nsuch as nurseries, vegetables, or turf production,\nwhere the system can be moved from the field before\nharvest. However, they also can be used with perma-\nnent crops, such as orchards and berries, where the\nportable laterals can be left in the field. This type of\nsystem is sometimes used to germinate crops, such as\nlettuce, which will later be furrow irrigated.\nAdvantages:\n• Reduced labor requirements because the pipe\ndoes not need to be moved while in the field.\n• Allows light applications at frequent intervals.\nDisadvantages:\n• High cost of needing sufficient lateral pipe and\nsprinklers to cover the entire field.\n• Can cause inconvenience for cultivation or other\ncultural operations.\n• Tall sprinkler risers need support, protection, or\nboth.\nWith portable mainline(s), control valves are typically\noperated manually. Renting a portable solid set system\nfor limited use (crop establishment, crop cooling,\nspecialty crops) can be more economical than owner-\nship.\nSolid set permanent laterals—This sprinkler\nirrigation system is similar to the portable system\nexcept both mainline(s) and laterals are generally\nburied below the depth of normal field operations.\nSprinkler lateral flow can be sequenced manually or\nautomatically by various timer activated electric\nsolenoid valves. With annual crops, the risers are\ninstalled outside of any tillage operations. This system\nis most adapted to permanent crops, such as orchards,\ngrapes, cranberries, cane berries, turf for landscaping,\nand golf courses. Solid set systems can be used on\nannual crops, alfalfa, or pasture. However, caution\nmust be exercised during tillage or harvest operations\nto prevent damage to risers and sprinkler heads.\nRisers must also be protected from livestock.\n(2) Design procedures\nDesign of solid set systems is similar to periodic move\nsystems. The only difference is that each lateral is\nindividually designed. Sizes can be effectively reduced\ntoward the end of the lateral as flow decreases. Blocks\nof laterals are then tied together using submains to\ncreate operating blocks or units and minimize the\nnumber of control valves. Individual sprinkler heads\nand spacing are designed to fit soil, crop, desired\napplication rates and amounts, local wind conditions,\nand management available. Figure 6–9 displays a solid\nset system layout.\nWith orchards and vineyards, tall risers can be used to\nprovide overhead irrigation. Quick couplings are\navailable for lowering sprinkler heads for maintenance\nand replacement. Minimum distribution uniformity\nstandards at ground level typically cannot be met\nwhen sprinkle irrigating fruit and nut orchards, citrus\ngroves, banana plantations, vineyards, cane berries,\nand tall bush berries from either overhead or ground\nlevel located sprinkler heads. However, minimum\ndistribution uniformity standards still apply for design\nand operation purposes. Lateral movement of soil\nwater is desirable and necessary in some soils to\nprevent dry spots in root development areas. In arid\nand semiarid areas, development of the support root\nsystem for trees and vines will only be in areas of",

Overhead systems are pre-\nferred for climate control systems, although recent\nresearch has shown some degree of protection can be\nobtained from undertree sprinklers.\nA diamond or triangular pattern for sprinkler head\nlayout is recommended for solid set systems, thereby\nimproving application uniformity. Adequate (typically\n50%) overlapping patterns from adjacent sprinkler\nnozzles are essential for temperature modification\nsystems and those used for shallow rooted annual\ncrops regardless of sprinkler head layout.

Sprinkler heads with nozzles\nmay be high or low pressure impact, gear driven, or\none of many low pressure spray heads. A higher dis-\ncharge, part circle, sprinkler head generally is used at\nthe extreme end of the lateral to irrigate the outer\nfringe of the lateral. Typically, 25 percent of lateral\nmaintenance is spent maintaining this end gun. Each\ntower, which is generally mounted on rubber tires, has\na power device designed to propel the system around\nthe pivot point. The most common power units include\nelectric motor drive, hydraulic water drive, and hy-\ndraulic oil drive.\nThe towers are spaced from 80 to 250 feet apart\n(span), and lateral lengths vary up to 2,600 feet (0.5\nmile). Long spans require a substantial truss or cable\nsystem to support the lateral pipe in place. The most\ncommon lateral length is 1,320 feet, which covers\nabout 125 to 140 acres per 160-acre field (quarter\nsection). With proper management, application effi-\nciencies can be 75 to 90 percent, depending on wind\nspeed and direction, sprinkler type, operating pres-\nsure, and tillage practices.\nUse of the center pivot has grown rapidly since it was\nfirst developed. Many improvements have been made.\nFor example, some models now contain an added\nswing lateral unit (corner system) that expands to\nreach the corners of a field and retracts to a trailing\nposition when the system is along the field edge. The\ncorner system unit operates only in the corners. When\nthe corner unit starts up, discharge flow in all other\nheads is reduced and overall field distribution unifor-\nmity is affected. These systems cover nearly 150 to 155\nacres of a square 160-acre (quarter section) field.\nTypically 85 percent of maintenance is spent maintain-\ning the swing lateral corner unit itself. Typically, less\nthan adequate maintenance results in corner systems\noperating all the time. Total field application unifor-\nmity is reduced even further.\nMany techniques have been developed to reduce energy\nused, lower system flow capacities, and maximize water\nuse efficiency. They include using Low Energy Precision\nApplication (LEPA) and Low Pressure In-Canopy (LPIC)\nsystems. LEPA systems (precision application) require\nadequate (implemented) soil, water, and plant manage-\nment. LPIC systems are used on lower value crops\nwhere localized water translocation is acceptable.\nAdvantages:\n• Operating labor is reduced as compared to\nperiodic move sprinkler systems. One individual\ncan adequately handle 8 to 10 center pivot sys-\ntems (1,000 to 1,500 acres)\n• Main supply line requirements are minimized\nbecause a stationary delivery point is used.\n• With good water management, relatively high\nwater application uniformity is possible.\n• With a full circle pivot, the lateral is at the start-\ning point after one revolution.\n• Because small amounts of water can be applied,\nit is relatively simple to maintain a high degree of\nwater management.\n• Light, frequent applications can be made.\n• With adequate design and reasonably level land,\nsystems with nozzle pressures as low as 10\npounds per square inch can be used.\n• Chemical applications (chemigation) can be\nmade through the system.\n• With multiple fields, some pivot laterals can be\ntowed to adjacent fields to be operated from\nseveral pivot points.\n• Pivots can operate as part circle systems because\nthey are capable of operating either forward or in\nreverse.\nLimitations:\n• Where the pivot point is in the center of a 160-\nacre field, only 125 to 140 acres are irrigated.\nThis leaves up to 20 percent of the field\nnonirrigated unless special units, such as corner\nsystems, are used to fill in the corners. Often\ncorners are irrigated with portable laterals or\nsolid set sprinkler systems. Graded furrow sur-\nface irrigation systems are also used for corners\nwhere soils are suitable, grades are uniform, and\ngated pipe is available.\n• Application rates at the outer end of a low pres-\nsure center pivot lateral can be 30 to 50 inches\nper hour (in/hr) for periods of 10 to 15 minutes,\ndepending on the length of the lateral and nozzle\nconfiguration. This can lead to translocation (or\nrunoff) of applied water and erosion where\nadequate soil surface storage is not provided.\nWhen using sprinkler heads discharging large\ndroplet sizes, soil surface compaction may in-\ncrease towards the outer edge of the circle. The\nlonger the pivot lateral and smaller the wetted\ndiameter of each sprinkler or spray head, the\ngreater the application rate.",

This increases potential water evapora-\ntion losses and may not be ideal for crops grown\nor water supply and system management. The\nirrigator must manage soil moisture more in-\ntensely throughout the season than with other\nsystems. Otherwise, soil moisture shortages can\noccur.\n• Because this system is relatively expensive\ncompared to other irrigation systems, center\npivot systems are often designed to barely meet,\nor even fall short of meeting, peak daily crop\nwater use. Unless the system is designed to fully\nmeet peak daily use, it generally cannot keep up\nin extended periods of extremely hot and dry\nconditions during maximum crop water use. An\nirrigation system should never be designed to\ndepend on adequate rainfall to occur during the\nirrigation period unless the producer adequately\nunderstands and fully accepts the risks involved.\nIf the producer accepts these risks, that a state-\nment in writing may be obtained to forestall\nfuture litigation.\n• With the radial distance from the pivot point,\nsuch concentric band includes a larger irrigated\narea. Thus, the most water must be carried\ntoward the outer end of the lateral. This results\nin lower pressures at the end of the lateral and\nhigher friction losses along the pipe, which\ntranslates into higher pumping costs when com-\npared to a linear move sprinkle irrigation system\nor other sprinkler irrigation systems.\n• When a large end gun or corner system is used\nfor the corners, a booster pump at the end of the\nlateral is typically used. When the booster pump\nto supply water to the large end guns and corner\nsystems comes on, all other sprinkler heads\nthroughout the length of the pivot lateral have\nless discharge. Overall field distribution unifor-\nmity is affected.\n• Maintenance costs of center pivot laterals with\ncorner systems is high, compared to standard\npivot systems.\nPlanning and design considerations:\nAn irrigation equipment dealer can use a computer\nprogram provided by each center pivot system manu-\nfacturer to perform a detailed design specific for that\nmake and model of pivot. Because sprinkler pipe size\nand head spacing combinations are unique for each\nmanufacturer, this is the only way accurate, detailed\ndesigns can be prepared. The farmer is generally\nprovided with a detailed copy of the design and nozzle\nconfiguration. Evaluating this information (including\nthe nozzling package) is always the first step when\nproviding a detailed field evaluation on a specific pivot\nsystem.\nAs a service to a cooperator, NRCS can review pivot\ndesigns prepared by others to assure the proposed\napplication provides adequate water to satisfy the\nneeds of the crop(s) and match the available water\ncapacity of the soil, and that it does not have negative\nimpacts on field or farm resources (soil, water, air,\nplants, animals, and human considerations) including\nsoil erosion, offsite sedimentation, and pollution of\nsurface and ground water. The planning technician\ncan provide daily crop water use and soil resource\ninformation, including limitations, to the irrigation\ndecisionmaker for use by the designer.\nEach pivot system manufacturer has a selection of\ncarefully designed packages from which to select.\nEach package has certain application characteristics.\nThe planning technician must be able to supply the\nland user with information on desirable characteristics\nso that the user can work with the dealer to select an\noptimum system package for the field. NRCS person-\nnel, irrigation dealers, manufacturers, and the user\nneed to work together as a team to get the best system\nfor onsite conditions installed and properly operated.\nResource site and system features that should be\nprovided include:\n• Maximum and normal irrigation water require-\nments of the crop(s).\n• Intake rate or maximum application rate for the\nmost limiting or restrictive soil, tillage practices,\nand available surface storage.\n• Translocation, runoff, and erosion potential.\n• Suitability of crop for irrigation method and\nsystem.\n• Available water capacity of limiting soil.\n• Actual crop rooting depth(s).\n• Irrigation decisionmaker management skill and\nlabor required.\nMaximum application rate for a pivot takes place in\nthe area between the outer two tower assemblies.

Application rate is constant for a\nspecific point regardless of lateral rotation\nspeed. Application volume (depth) is totally\nindependent on the lateral rotation speed. The\nnarrower the width of spray pattern, the higher the\napplication rate. Low pressure spray heads typically\nhave a narrow width of spray pattern. Because of this\nnarrow spray pattern, LEPA and LPIC systems can\nhave application rates exceeding 30 to 50 inches per\nhour for short time periods.\nSprinkler nozzles on continuously moving lateral\nsystems apply water in a stationary pattern similar to\nan ellipse. Application rates at a point a given distance\nperpendicular to the pivot lateral begin at zero until\ndroplets begin impacting. They reach a maximum\nwhen the center of the sprinkler head (lateral) is\ndirectly above the point, and decrease again to zero\nwhen the trailing edge of the application pattern\npasses the point. The depth applied at the given point\nis represented by the area under the application rate\nversus time curve. To achieve a uniform depth of\napplication over the entire area of the circle (field),\napplication rates must increase as the distance from\nthe pivot point increases. Elapsed time of application\ndecreases.\nAs can be seen in figure 6–10, intake characteristics of\na soil are a function of rate over time. When applica-\ntion rates are greater than the soil intake rate curve, a\npotential for translocation or runoff occurs unless soil\nsurface storage is provided. For a given application\namount, the wider the wetted sprinkler pattern, the\nless the application rate. Narrower (typically lower\npressure) wetted sprinkler pattern sprinkler nozzles\nprovide greater application rates. Table 6–5 displays\ntypical wetted patterns and operating pressures of\nvarious sprinkler heads on center pivot systems.\nThe speed of lateral rotation normally varies from 12\nto 120 hours per revolution. With a center pivot sys-\ntem, the application rate (in/hr) at any one location is\nthe same, regardless of the speed of rotation. How-\never, the greater the lateral speed the less total water\nis applied in a given area for a given rotation.

A system of alignment controls keeps the other\ntowers in line with the master tower. To maintain\nalignment, the towers are continually in start-stop\noperation. If a tower gets stuck and cannot move, the\nsystem shuts down (if automatic system shutoff is\nfunctioning).\nWith a properly designed, maintained, and managed\ncenter pivot system, water application depth is rela-\ntively uniform over the length of the lateral after\nseveral rotations. The start-stop characteristics of the\nsystem can cause nonuniformity in a small area on one\nrotation. With additional rotations, nonuniformity due\nto start-stop action of individual towers is minimized.\nOverall system maintenance is important. Clogged\nsprinklers, improperly functioning flow regulators, and\nimproper system pressures quickly degrade uniformity\nof application. Applicator maintenance is most impor-\ntant towards the outer end of the lateral because of the\nlarge area covered by only a few nozzles.\nFigure 6–11 shows percent of total area of application\nversus radius for a quarter-mile-long lateral.\nOccasionally, pivots up to a half mile long are in-\nstalled. These pivots have very high application rates\nin the outer quarter to third of the irrigated area and\ncan work properly only under certain conditions. Most\nimportant of these conditions are:\n• Topography must be flat enough to allow high\napplication rates at the outer part of the circle\nwithout significant translocation, runoff, and\nerosion.\n• Soil must have a relatively high intake rate.\n• Soil surface storage (surface roughness).\n• Crops that can be established under high\napplication rates are grown.\n• Cultural practices that promote surface residue\nutilization for improved soil condition and sur-\nface storage, such as pitting, are implemented\nand maintained throughout the irrigation season.\nTable 6–5 \tTypical operating pressures and wetted\ndiameter patterns\nSystem \tOperating \tWetted\npressure \tdiameter\n(lb/in2 ) \t(ft)\nHeads mounted on top of lateral pipe\nHigh pressure impact \t75 + \t160\nMedium pressure impact \t50 - 75 \t100 - 130\nLow pressure impact \t35 - 50 \t40 - 100\n360-degree spray, low pressure \t20 - 35 \t20 - 40\n180-degree spray, low pressure \t20 - 35 \t10 - 20\nRotating spray \t15 - 50 \tup to 70\nSpray booms, low pressure \t20 - 35 \t120\nHeads mounted on drop tubes\nFixed spray, low pressure \t20 - 35 \t20 - 40\nRotating spray \t15 - 50 \tup to 60\nLPIC application devices 1/ \t5 - 10 \t5 - 15\nLEPA application devices 2/ \t2 - 10 \t2 - 5\n1/ \tLPIC = Low Pressure In Canopy\n2/ \tLEPA = Low Energy Precision Application\nFigure 6–11 \tApplication area along a quarter-mile-long\npivot system lateral\n25% of area\n25% of area\n25% of area\n25% of area\n660 ft\n273 ft\n210 ft\n177 ft\nPercent of area\n100\n75\n50\n25\nLateral length\n1,320 ft\n1,143 ft\n933 ft\n660 ft\nAcres\n125.66\n94.24\n62.83\n31.42",

Drop tubes that have low\npressure spray heads located a few inches above the\nground surface or canopy are often used instead of\nsprinkler heads attached directly to the lateral. Drop\ntubes and lower pressure (larger droplets) reduce\nwind and evaporation losses.\nCenter pivot systems can be operated as either high or\nlow pressure systems. Low pressure systems are\nbecoming more desirable because of reduced energy\nuse. Where pressure (flow) regulators are not re-\nquired, pressures of 5 to 10 pounds per square inch in\nthe lateral are used for Low Energy Precision Applica-\ntion (LEPA) and Low Pressure In Canopy (LPIC)\nsystems. Center pivots used as LEPA and LPIC require\ntemporary soil surface storage because of very high\napplication rates; otherwise, surface water transloca-\ntion and runoff occur. Temporary surface storage, plus\ninfiltration during the application period, must be\ncapable of storing the planned application amount per\nirrigation. Surface storage can be provided with sur-\nface residue, soil roughness, or small basins. Adequate\nsoil surface storage must be available throughout the\nirrigation season.\nSome center pivot systems use a large partial circle,\nhydraulic-revolving gun type sprinkler at the end of\nthe lateral line. This sprinkler extends the irrigated\ndiameter of the pivot to help fill in corners of the field.\nThe area covered by the gun seldom receives as much\nwater as the remainder of the field. Generally, this is\nthe area producing the poorest yields. Typically over\n75 percent of total maintenance is required by the end\ngun.\nA total system economic analysis of inputs and out-\nputs needs to be made to determine whether increased\ncrop yields from the irrigated area served by the end\ngun covers costs. Costs include lower total field water\napplication uniformity, reduced water supply for the\nremainder of the field, increased tillage area, and\nincreased labor to maintain the end gun.\nRecommendations for reducing operational\nproblems associated with center pivot sprin-\nkler systems:\nCrops can be planted in circular rows around\nthe center pivot system rather than planting in\nstraight rows. Circular planting results in 94 percent\nof the rows being longer than those in traditional\nfields. This type planting reduces wheel traction prob-\nlems for the center pivot machine, increases irrigation\nuniformity, and can reduce runoff and soil erosion. A\nvery light water application should be used to leave\ntire tracks as a guide for planting equipment. Always\napply water when creating guide markings. Weight of\nwater in the pipeline can extend the lateral length\nseveral feet compared to it’s empty lateral length.\nTower wheel rutting problems can be a severe\noperational problem where medium textured\nsoils with poor structure become wet. As a rut\ndeepens, it collects water and saturates the soil thus\nincreasing the rutting problem. Erosion can occur in\nthe ruts on sloping fields as a result of the concen-\ntrated flow. Using boom-backs to place the spray\nbehind the tower helps to alleviate this problem.\nIrrigation uniformity can be improved by\nsmoothing the land under the center pivot sys-\ntem to remove any minor undulations and local-\nized steep slopes. Best results are achieved using a\ncropping system that maintains crop residue at the\nground surface. A no-till system of residue manage-\nment is a desirable alternative.\nUse furrow pitting and diking in the outer quar-\nter of the irrigated area. Various machines can be\nused to make dikes or basins in the furrow area every\nfew feet. Applied irrigation water and precipitation are\nstored to prevent translocation and runoff.\nIn arid and semiarid areas, pre-irrigation (irri-\ngation before the soil is prepared for planting)\nmay be a desirable management practice. The\nidea is to at least partly fill the root zone with moisture\nbefore working the soil and planting the crop. This\nhelps create a deep root system and stores moisture\nfor use during periods when the sprinkler system is\nunable to keep up with crop needs. Pre-irrigation is\nseldom needed in humid areas.",

Experience has shown frequent\nirrigation often seals the soil, reduces water infiltra-\ntion, and increases evaporation. Excessive speed also\ncauses unnecessary wear and tear on the equipment.\nIn arid areas 0.25 to 0.50 inch of the application\namount can be lost to soil and plant evaporation with\neach revolution. Thus when water supplies are short\nor become short, consider sacrificing part of the crop\narea and slowing the pivot to apply more water with\neach rotation. Eliminating irrigation on part of the\ncircle for the latter part of the season may be more\nbeneficial and provide a higher quality product on the\nfully irrigated portion.\nDeep chiseling or ripping may be beneficial to\nremove root and water restrictive tillage pans\nand temporarily increase soil intake rate (par-\nticularly on clay loam soil). This is an expensive\nfield operation, and unless the cause of compaction is\ncorrected, the operation must be repeated. Heavy\nequipment, tillage when wet, excess tillage, or poor\nsoil condition often cause tillage pans to reoccur.\nDesign procedures:\nThe hydraulic design of a center pivot sprinkler system\nis complex. Today, most systems are designed using\none of several computer programs usually by the\ncompany proposing to do the installation. The follow-\ning equation can be used for guidance to determine if\nmaximum application rates and depths of water ap-\nplied by center pivot sprinklers are in accordance with\nNRCS standards.

With center pivots,\nboth the average application rate and the maximum\napplication rate increases the further the point in the\nfield is located from the pivot. To calculate the average\nand maximum application rate along a center pivot\nlateral, the total lateral capacity and radius can be\nused. Equations are provided as follows:\nI rQ\nR w\n= ( \t)\t2 96 3\n2\n. or \tI rQ\nR w\nx = 245\n2\nwhere:\nI \t= average application rate at point r (in/hr)\nQ = system capacity (gpm)\nr \t= radius from center of pivot to point under study\n(ft)\nw = wetted width of sprinkler pattern (ft)\nR = maximum radius irrigated (ft)\nI x = maximum application rate at any point r (in/hr)\n(assuming elliptical application pattern of sprin-\nkler head with a multiplier of 4/π)\nWhere r, R, Q, and w are held constant:\nI \tI\tx = 1 25\t.\n(2) Low energy precision application (LEPA)\nsystems\nLEPA is a low energy precision water application\nsystem that supplies water at the point of use. This\nsystem combines a self moving mechanical device\n(center pivot or linear move) along with water and soil\nmanagement to produce retention and efficient use of\nall water received (precipitation and irrigation). The\nsoil surface and residue management provide adequate\nwater infiltration and temporary surface water stor-\nage. The LEPA management program provides near\nzero water translocation or runoff.",

The\nonly association with a center pivot and linear\nsprinkler systems is with the actual mechanical\nsystem itself. LEPA systems distribute water\ndirectly onto or very near the ground surface,\nbelow the crop canopy through drop tubes fitted\nwith low pressure (5 to 10 lb/in2) application\ndevices. Because system operating pressures are\nlow, pumping energy is reduced compared to\nstandard systems.\n• Lower system capacities per unit area are gener-\nally used for LEPA as compared to conventional\nsurface and sprinkle systems. This method of\napplying water close to the ground surface\nessentially eliminates wind drift and evaporation\nlosses especially after the crop has gotten taller\nthan 18 inches. With adequate soil (tillage and\nresidue) management, translocation and field\nrunoff are eliminated. Practically all losses result\nfrom deep percolation below the crop root zone.\nThese losses can be minimized if the irrigation\ndecisionmaker follows an adequate program of\nirrigation scheduling. Application efficiencies of\n95 percent and an application device discharge\ncoefficient uniformity of more than 96 percent\nshould be the objectives of the irrigation\ndecisionmaker. The concept of precision irriga-\ntion should prevail with operation and manage-\nment of LEPA systems.\nLimitations:\nLEPA is generally used on field slopes of 1 percent or\nless on a significant portion of the field. Planned\nmaximum water application depth per irrigation or\nprecipitation event should not exceed soil surface\nstorage volume less infiltration during the event.\nApplication rates exceeding 30 inches per hour, for\nshort periods of time, have been measured on the\nouter end of low pressure center pivot laterals. LEPA\nrequires cultural and residue management practices\nthat provide adequate season-long soil surface storage.\nBasins constructed with furrow pitting or diking\nequipment is required, especially on low and medium\nintake soils. The small basins hold irrigation and pre-\ncipitation until total infiltration occurs, thus eliminating\nrunoff and improving water distribution uniformity.\nPlanning and design considerations:\nLEPA systems must be capable of conveying and\ndischarging water within a single furrow area. Water is\ntypically confined between two adjacent crop rows.\nThe application device is typically attached to the end\nof drop tubes that are located or positioned in either\nevery furrow or in alternate furrows. Discharge de-\nvices must place water near or directly onto the soil\nsurface. For precision application of irrigation water\nusing LEPA systems, circular rows must be used with\ncenter pivots and straight rows with linear systems.\nApplication devices should distribute and confine the\nwater to the furrow area without eroding furrow dikes\nor crop beds. To optimize water placement, planting\nshould be done to match the travel pattern and loca-\ntion of the drop tube applicators.\nMinimum system capacity should be based on local\ncrop ET needs for crops grown in the crop rotation,\naccounting for the available water capacity of specific\nsoils in the field.\nSome minor land grading may be needed to remove\nlocalized high and low areas in the field to provide\nuniform application device heights above the soil\nsurface between towers. Spacing and location of drop\ntubes must coincide with crop row spacing. Water\nmust not be applied into the tower track. Cross flow\nfrom adjacent furrows to the wheel track should also\nbe avoided.\nLEPA application devices should contain flow control\ndevices or pressure regulators, or both, where needed.\nApplication devices are normally convertible to at\nleast two of the following modes: bubble, flat spray,\nchemigation, and drag sock. The application device\nshould distribute the water within or across the furrow\nwidth without causing erosion of the crop bed, dams,\nand dikes, and thus diminishing soil surface storage.\nSoil surface storage—The following provides field\nstorage capacity and sizing of typical basins at 0 per-\ncent field slope:\nStorage \t- - - - - Basins - - - - - \tBasin dimensions \tDike \tRow\nevery row \talt row \ttop \tbot. \tspace space\nwidth \twidth\n(in) \t(in) \t(in) \t(in) \t(in)\n2.0 \tx \t18 \t6 \t60 \t36\n1.0 \tx \t18 \t6 \t60 \t60",

LPIC irrigation\nsystems typically have some local translocation of\napplied water, but no field runoff. In most areas local\ntranslocation is interpreted as having water on the soil\nsurface no further than 30 feet ahead of or behind the\nlateral position. Good soil and water management are\nrequired to obtain potential application efficiencies in\nthe high 80’s.\nAdvantages:\n• The LPIC method of distributing water within the\ncrop canopy can be installed on soils and topog-\nraphy unsuitable for the LEPA management\nsystem. LPIC systems distribute water through\ndrop tubes fitted with low pressure (5 to 10 lb/\nin 2) application devices. Because system operat-\ning pressures are low, pumping energy is re-\nduced compared to above canopy or high pres-\nsure center pivot and linear move systems.\n• With good water and soil management and\nmedium to coarse textured soils, LPIC irrigation\nsystems have been successfully used on slopes\nup to 6 percent. Good soil condition and ad-\nequate soil surface storage for applied water\n(precipitation and irrigation) are essential. Ter-\nracing may be required to control rainfall and\nirrigation induced erosion on steeper slopes.\n• Lower system capacities per unit area generally\nare used for LPIC as compared to above canopy\nsprinkle irrigation systems. In-canopy applica-\ntions essentially eliminate wind drift and evapo-\nration losses especially after the crop has grown\ntaller than 18 inches. With proper water and soil\nmanagement, application efficiencies of at least\n85 percent can be obtained. Application device\ndischarge coefficient uniformity can be more\nthan 90 percent.\nLimitations:\n• LPIC is generally used with field slopes of 3\npercent or less on a significant portion of the\nfield. Maximum application depth per irrigation\nor precipitation event should not exceed soil\nsurface storage less infiltration during the event.\nExcellent soil condition and surface storage\nmust be maintained throughout the irrigation\nseason. Application rates in excess of 30 inches\nper hour, for short periods of time, have been\nmeasured at the outer end of low pressure center\npivot laterals.\n• Even with proper water and soil management,\nLPIC irrigation systems generally are not suitable\nfor use on low intake soils.\n• Maintaining dikes or basins is difficult on soil\nslopes greater than 3 percent.\n• Terraces may be needed to prevent erosion on\nslopes greater than 2 percent.\nPlanning and design considerations:\nLow pressure in canopy (LPIC) systems must be\ncapable of applying water without significant translo-\ncation or field runoff. Application devices on drop\ntubes can be spaced from 2 to 10 feet. Experience has\nshown crop yields are adversely affected because of\npoor application uniformity when using a wider spac-\ning. Nonuniformity exists with any drop tube spacing\ngreater than every other row. Many irrigation decision-\nmakers feel reducing the initial investment by using a\nwider application device (and drop tube) spacing is\njustified.\nApplication devices should deliver water to the furrow\narea without eroding furrow dikes, dams, or crop\nbeds. Planting orientation should match the travel\npattern or direction of lateral movement. A very light\nwater application can be used to leave tire tracks to\nguide planting equipment. Always apply water when\ncreating guide markings. Weight of water in the lateral\npipeline can extend the length several feet.\nMinimum system capacity should be based on local\ncrop ET needs for crops grown in the crop rotation,\naccounting for the available water capacity for specific\nsoils in the field.\nSome minor land grading may be needed to remove\nsmall high and low areas in the field to provide a near\nuniform application device height above the soil\nsurface between lateral towers. Spacing and location\nof drop tubes need to coincide with crop row spacing\nand the location of the rows within the lateral span of\nthe mechanical irrigation system. Water should not be\napplied into the tire track. Cross flow from adjacent\nfurrows to the wheel track should also be avoided.",

These devices should distribute water\nuniformly across the soil surface without excessive\ncrop interference. The LPIC system is used for center\npivot and linear move laterals. LPIC is a low pressure\nwithin canopy system. It is similar to LEPA, but does\nnot have the site and application restrictions. It may\nnot have the precision application required of LEPA\nand is more likely to have translocation and erosion\nproblems.\n(4) Linear (lateral) move sprinkler irrigation\nsystems\nA linear move sprinkle irrigation system is a continu-\nous, self-moving, straight lateral that irrigates a rectan-\ngular field. The commonly used term, continuous\nmove, is not totally accurate because the lateral moves\nin a timed start-stop operation. The system is similar\nto the center pivot lateral in that the lateral pipe is\nsupported by trusses, cables, and towers mounted on\nwheels. A linear move sprinkle irrigation system is\nsimilar to a side roll wheel line system because it\nirrigates a rectangular field with uniform sized nozzles\nand spacing throughout the length of the lateral.\nMost linear systems are driven by electric motors\nlocated in each tower. A self-aligning system is used to\nmaintain near straight line uniform travel. One tower\nis the master control tower for the lateral where the\nspeed is set, and all other towers operate in start-stop\nmode to maintain alignment. A small cable mounted 12\nto 18 inches above the ground surface along one edge\nor the center of the field guides the master control\ntower across the field.\nLinear move systems can be equipped with a variety of\nsprinkler or spray heads. Drop tubes and low pressure\nspray heads located a few inches above ground sur-\nface or crop canopy can be used instead of sprinkler\nheads attached directly to the lateral. Both options\nreduce wind and evaporation losses.\nLinear move systems can be operated as either high or\nlow pressure systems. Low pressure systems are\nbecoming common because of reduced energy use.\nLow pressures of 5 to 10 pounds per square inch (plus\n4 pounds per square inch with pressure regulators) are\nused where linear systems are used as Low Energy\nPrecision Application (LEPA) and Low Pressure In\nCanopy (LPIC) systems.\nWhere linear move systems are used as LEPA and\nLPIC, temporary soil surface storage is necessary to\nlimit surface water translocation or runoff because of\nthe high application rates. Temporary surface storage,\nplus infiltration during the application period, must be\ncapable of receiving the application amount per irriga-\ntion. Surface storage can be provided with surface\nresidue, small basins, or both. Surface storage must be\navailable throughout the irrigation season. Application\nrates are medium to high.\nAdvantages:\nThe major advantage of linear move sprinkler irriga-\ntion systems is that all the field is irrigated. Applica-\ntion uniformity can be high because the laterals are\nnearly continuously moving. Because of the potential\nfor high application uniformity and the ability to put\non small amounts of water (at higher lateral speeds),\nseveral forms of chemigation are practical.\nLimitations:\nThe major disadvantages of linear move sprinkle\nirrigation systems are high initial cost, high annual\noperating cost, and need to supply water to the moving\nlateral. Generally, this type system is used on medium\nto high value crops and for multiple crop production\nareas. Unlike center pivots, when laterals reach the\nedge of the field and irrigation is complete, the laterals\nmust be moved. They are either moved back (dead\nheaded) to the starting position or moved endwise to\nan adjacent field. When moving the lateral endwise,\ntower wheels must be rotated 90 degrees or be placed\non individual tower dollies.\nPlanning and design considerations:\nNEH, Part 623 (Section 15), Chapter 11, Sprinkle\nIrrigation, page 11–109, provides details concerning\ndesign. Manufacturers’ technical data should be con-\nsulted for additional machine specific up-to-date\ninformation.\nField layout and water source delivery methods must\nbe considered when planning and designing a linear\nmove system. Figure 6–12 displays typical alternatives\nfor field layout showing water source locations. Water\ncan be supplied to the moving lateral system by using\nan engine driven centrifugal pump or by using pipe-\nlines and risers to move water under pressure.",

The engine also runs a DC\ngenerator to provide power for tower drive motors.\nThe ditch can be located anywhere in the field perpen-\ndicular to the lateral, but is generally located in the\ncenter of the field or along one edge. The ditch must\nbe installed on a relatively flat grade to provide ad-\nequate water depth without overtopping. A moving\nend dam checks water moving in the concrete lined\nditch and provides submergence over the pump suc-\ntion pipeline inlet. A screen on the pump suction\npipeline helps to prevent debris from entering the\nlateral.\nWater under pressure can be supplied to the moving\nlateral irrigation system via a buried pipeline and\nrisers. The pipeline must be located perpendicular to\nthe moving lateral, typically in the center of the field\nor along one edge. Typically a flexible hose connects\nthe moving lateral pipe to riser valves on the buried\npipeline. Riser connect/disconnect can be manual or\nautomated.\nWhen operated manually, the system must be stopped\nwith each mainline outlet (riser) change. Spacing of\noutlet risers is dependent on the length and size of\nhose the irrigator is able to drag from one outlet riser\nto the next. A small tractor can tow the hose, thereby\nallowing wider spacing of outlet risers. Slower lateral\nspeeds and higher application amounts keep manual\nlabor and the wear and tear on the hose to a minimum.\nWhen riser connect/disconnect is automated, a pow-\nered valve opener proceeds the moving lateral drag-\nging the supply hose in search of the next riser. If a\nriser is not found, the valve opener returns to the\nmaster tower and repeats the search process.\nUpon locating a riser valve, the valve opener aligns\nitself over the riser, secures the valve body, and opens\nthe valve. Water pressure in the forward supply hose\nsignals a rear valve body and supply hose to discon-\nnect. The rear powered valve body with supply hose\nmoves towards the lateral, searching for the next\nriser. When secured, water pressure in the rear valve\nbody and hose signals the forward valve body to\nFigure 6–12 \tTypical field layout of linear systems\nLinear move\nDirection of travel\nSupply ditch/pipeline\nWater\nsource\nLinear move\nDirection of travel\nSupply ditch/pipeline\nWater\nsource\nSupply ditch/pipeline center of field\nSupply ditch/pipeline along field edge",

The moving lateral proceeds down the\nfield as water is supplied alternately by forward and\nrear valve connections.\n(e) Traveling gun sprinkler\nirrigation systems\nThe traveling gun (traveler, gun, big gun) is a high-\ncapacity, single-nozzle sprinkler fed with water from a\nflexible hose that is either dragged on the soil surface\nor wound on a reel. The gun is mounted on wheels and\ntravels along a straight line while operating. The unit is\nequipped with a water piston or water turbine pow-\nered winch that reels in an anchored cable or hose.\nSome units have a small auxiliary gasoline engine to\npower the reel. This eliminates the water pressure\nrequired to operate the reel, and the hose speed is\nconsistent. The cable guides the unit along a path and\ntows a high-pressure flexible hose connected to the\nwater supply system. Figure 6–13 displays a typical\ntraveling gun type system layout.\nApplication depth is regulated by the speed at which\nthe hose or cable reel is operated or by the speed of a\nself-contained power unit. Traveling sprinklers are\nwell adapted to odd shaped fields and to tall field\ncrops, such as corn, if wetting adjacent areas is not a\nproblem.\nAs the traveler moves along its path, the sprinkler\nwets a 200- to 400-foot-wide strip of land. After the\nunit reaches the end of a travel path, it is moved and\nset to water an adjacent strip of land. The overlap of\nadjacent strips depends on the distance between\ntravel paths, diameter wetted by the sprinkler, aver-\nage wind speed, and application pattern of the sprin-\nkler used. The sprinkler is reset by towing it to the\nedge of the field.\nSprinkler discharge flows can range from 50 to more\nthan 1,000 gallons per minute with nozzles ranging\nfrom 0-.5 to 1.75 inches in diameter and operating\npressure from 60 to more than 120 pounds per square\ninch.

The three general types of traveling gun\nsprinklers are cable reel, hose reel, and self-powered/\npropelled.\nCable reel—The cable reel unit has a large gun type\nsprinkler mounted on a 4-wheel chassis equipped with\na water piston or turbine-powered winch that reels in\nan anchored cable. The cable guides the unit along a\npath as it tows a high-pressure, flexible, lay-flat hose\nthat is connected to the water supply system. The\ntypical hose is 4 to 5 inches in diameter and up to 660\nfeet long. This allows the unit to travel up to 1,320 feet.\nAfter use, the hose can be drained and wound onto a\nreel.\nHose reel—The hose reel unit is equipped with a\nwater turbine or gasoline auxiliary engine to power\nthe hose reel. The hose reel can be located either at\nthe sprinkler or at the water source (pipe outlet valve).\nWhen included with the sprinkler, a 4-wheel chassis\ncarries the hose reel and sprinkler, which is pulled in\nby the hose attached to a water source (pipe outlet\nvalve). The hose is usually flexible, reinforced, poly-\nethylene material and is typically between 4 and 5\ninches in diameter. Generally, the maximum hose\nlength is 850 feet. This allows the unit to move 1,700\nfeet.\nSelf-powered/propelled—This unit has a self-con-\ntained pump and is self-propelled by drive wheels. A\ngun type sprinkler is mounted on top of the unit. The\nmachine straddles a supply ditch and is guided by the\nditch.\n(1) Advantages\n• Odd shaped fields can be irrigated with auto-\nmated equipment.\n• Manual labor is minimized.\n• Suitable on sandy or high intake rate soils.\n• Suitable for irrigating several different fields in a\ncrop rotation.\n(2) Limitations\n• Traveling gun type sprinklers are not suitable on\nlow intake rate soils or soils that tend to surface\nseal as a result of puddling.\n• The turbines to power the winch and fittings on\nhose fed systems require additional water supply\npressure. Because of the typical field size and the\ndesire to keep costs down, it is tempting to\nreduce the flexible hose size for the length re-\nquired. Decreased capital cost is a trade-off for\nincreased energy cost. An energy cost analysis\nshould be made. When possible, manufacturers’\ntechnical data should be used to make the analy-\nsis.\nTable 6–6 \tTypical discharges and wetted diameters for gun type sprinklers with 24° angles of trajectory and tapered\nnozzles operating when there is no wind\nSprinkler \tSprinkler discharge and wetted diameter\npressure \t- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - tapered nozzle size (in) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n- - - - - - - 0.8 - - - - - - - \t- - - - - - - 1.0 - - - - - - \t- - - - - - - 1.2 - - - - - - \t- - - - - - - 1.4 - - - - - - \t- - - - - - - 1.6 - - - - - -\n(lb/in 2) \tgpm \tft \tgpm \tft \tgpm \tft \tgpm \tft \tgpm \tft\n60 \t143 \t285 \t225 \t325 \t330 \t365 \t— \t— \t— \t—\n70 \t155 \t300 \t245 \t340 \t355 \t380 \t480 \t435 \t— \t—\n80 \t165 \t310 \t260 \t355 \t380 \t395 \t515 \t455 \t675 \t480\n90 \t175 \t320 \t275 \t365 \t405 \t410 \t545 \t470 \t715 \t495\n100 \t185 \t330 \t290 \t375 \t425 \t420 \t575 \t480 \t755 \t510\n110 \t195 \t340 \t305 \t385 \t445 \t430 \t605 \t490 \t790 \t520\n120 \t205 \t350 \t320 \t395 \t465 \t440 \t630 \t500 \t825 \t535",

Well graded soils and soils low in or-\nganic matter are subject to puddling or surface\ncompaction, thus further reducing soil intake\nrate and increasing potential translocation. Some\ncrops may also be damaged by large droplet\nsizes.\n• To adequately irrigate edges of the field, water is\napplied outside of the field boundaries.\n(3) Planning and design considerations\nLarge gun type sprinklers require the highest pressures\nof any sprinkler system. In addition to the high operat-\ning pressure required at the sprinkler nozzle, hose\nlosses can add another 20 to 40 pounds per square\ninch to the total system dynamic pressure head (TDH).\nTherefore, gun type sprinklers are well suited to\nsupplemental irrigation where seasonal net irrigation\nrequirements are small. This helps to mitigate the high\npower costs associated with high operating pressure.\nAn energy cost evaluation should be made. Traveling\ngun sprinklers can be used where crops and irrigation\nneeds are rotated from field to field. Table 6–7 displays\nfriction loss in flexible pressure irrigation hose used\non traveling gun type sprinklers.\nDistribution uniformity is typically fair in the inner\npart of a 100- to 200-foot-wide strip; however, along\nthe ends and sides it is poor. Typically, the ends and\nsides of the strip are inadequately irrigated. Applica-\ntion uniformity of large gun sprinklers is adversely\naffected by wind speeds of more than 5 miles per hour.\nA gun type system is not recommended in windy areas.\nPower requirements to drag a hose depend on the size\nof hose, soil texture, soil moisture conditions, and\ncrop. Pull energy requirement is greatest on wet, bare,\nsticky soils and less on wet vegetation or bare, sandy\nsoils. On sticky soils the tow paths for the traveling\nunit and hose should be left in grass or other vegeta-\ntion. Excessive wear to the hose can occur on soils\ncontaining sharp or abrasive rock fragments.\nGuidelines for sizing traveling gun type sprinkler hoses\nare shown in table 6–8. Table 6–9 displays recom-\nmended maximum travel lane spacing as a function of\nwetted diameter and average wind speed. The gross\ndepth of water applied for continuous moving large\ngun type sprinkler heads is given in table 6–10.\nTable 6–7 \tFriction loss in flexible irrigation hose used\non traveling gun type sprinkle system\nFlow \tFriction Loss (lb/in2 /100 ft)\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - hose size (in) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n(gpm) \t2 1/2 \t3 \t3 1/2 \t4 \t4 1/2 \t5\n- - - - - - - - - - - - lb/in 2 per 100 ft - - - - - - - - - - - -\n100 \t1.6 \t0.7 \t0.3\n150 \t3.4 \t1.4\n200 \t5.6 \t2.5 \t1.4 \t0.6\n250 \t3.6 \t0.9\n300 \t5.1 \t2.6 \t1.3 \t0.6\n400 \t2.3 \t1.3\n500 \t3.5 \t2.1\n600 \t4.9 \t2.7 \t1.1\n700 \t3.6 \t2.1\n800 \t4.6 \t2.7\n900 \t3.4\n1000 \t4.2",

It is\nalso referred to as drip or trickle irrigation.\nWater is applied as discrete or continuous drops, tiny\nstreams, or miniature spray through drip emitters or\nspray heads placed along a water delivery line called a\nlateral or feeder line. Typically, water is dispensed\nfrom a pipe distribution network under low pressure\n(5 to 20 lb/in 2) in a predetermined pattern. The outlet\ndevice that controls water release is called an emitter.\nWater moves through the soil from the emission point\nto soil areas of higher water tension by both capillary\nand gravity forces. The amount of soil wetted depends\non soil characteristics, length of irrigation period,\nemitter discharge, and number and spacing of emit-\nters. Number and spacing of emitters are dependent\non the spacing and size of plants being irrigated. If\nwater management is adequate, line source emitters\ncan be used for row crops. Micro irrigation can effi-\nciently distribute an otherwise limited water supply.\nWith proper water management, application efficien-\ncies for a well designed, installed, and maintained\nmicro irrigation system can be in the range of 80 to 90\npercent for the area irrigated. Without proper water\nmanagement, they are typically 55 to 65 percent. By far\nthe greatest water management problem is over-\nirrigation.\nPrincipal uses for micro irrigation systems are provid-\ning water for windbreaks, vegetables, berries, grapes,\nfruit, citrus and nut orchards, nursery stock, and\nlandscape and ornamental plantings. Figure 6–14\nshows a typical micro irrigation system layout in an\norchard. In areas where the water supply is inadequate\nand water cost is high, subsurface micro systems can\nbe cost effective for irrigation of high value row crops.\nBuried line source lateral systems have been in con-\ntinuous operation since 1982.\n(b) Types of micro irrigation\nsystems\n(1) Point-source emitters (drip/trickle/\nbubbler)\nIn the point-source form of micro irrigation, water is\napplied to the soil surface as discrete or continuous\ndrops, tiny streams, or low volume fountain through\nsmall openings. Discharge is in units of gallons per\nhour (gph) or gallons per minute (gpm) over a speci-\nfied pressure range. Discharge rates typically range\nfrom 0.5 gallon per hour to nearly 0.5 gallon per\nminute for individual drip emitters.\nMicrotubes (spaghetti tubing) are classed as point-\nsource emitters even though they are actually tubes\nrather than emitters. Microtubes consist of various\nlengths of flexible tubing that is small in diameter (.020\nto .040 inch). Typically, no other water control device\nis used. Discharge rates are adjusted by varying the\nlength of the tubing. The longer the tube, the greater\nthe friction loss, which decreases the discharge rate.\nBecause discharge orifices are small, complete filtra-\ntion of water is required. Bubblers are commonly used\nwith ornamental landscape plantings, orchards, and\ngrape vineyards. Flows are generally less than 1 gallon\nper minute. Figure 6–15 illustrates typical drip emitter\ndevices.",

The streams have a point discharge rate\ngreater than that for a typical drip or line source\nsystem, but generally less than 1 gallon per minute.\nThe discharge rate normally exceeds the infiltration\nrate of the soil, so small basins are used to contain the\nwater until infiltration occurs. Discharge is generally\nfrom a small diameter (3/8 to 1/2 inch) flexible tube\nthat is attached to a buried or surface lateral and\nlocated at each plant vine or tree. The typical emitter\ndevice is not used, and discharge pressures are very\nlow (< 5 lb/in 2). Figure 6–17 displays a typical basin\nbubbler system.\nBasin bubblers are used in orchards and landscaping\nand ornamental plantings. These systems are best used\nwith medium to fine textured soils where lateral water\nmovement can provide adequate soil moisture for the\ndesirable plant root development area. With coarse\ntextured soils, bubbler discharge rates are increased\nand shorter time periods used, thereby providing more\nwetted area above the potential plant root zone.\nThe discharge orifice is larger than that of the other\nsystems, so little or no water filtration is required.\nGenerally, screening of coarse debris and small crea-\ntures is sufficient. Drains must be provided to allow\ndischarge of any collected sediment.\nFlow to each discharge point is controlled by adjusting\nthe elevation at the outflow end of the tubing. The\ntubing is attached to a support stake. Decreasing the\nelevation along the lateral compensates for head loss\nin the lateral.\nThis simple system distributes water uniformly to each\ntree without special flow regulating devices. Operating\npressures less than 2 pounds per square inch can\ndistribute water on up to 10 acres. Bubbler basins\napply water to a larger soil volume than do drip emit-\nters; therefore, only one outlet device is needed per\nplant or tree. This promotes increased root develop-\nment that may be needed to support the plant in windy\nareas. Irrigation scheduling is also easier.\n(4) Spray or mini sprinkler\nWith spray or mini sprinkler micro irrigation systems,\nwater is applied to the soil surface as spray droplets\nfrom small, low-pressure heads. The typical wetted\ndiameter is 2 to 7 feet. Discharge rates are generally\nless than 30 gallons per hour (0.5 gpm). The wetted\npattern is larger than that of typical drip emitter de-\nvices, and generally fewer application devices are\nneeded per plant.\nSpray and mini sprinklers also have less plugging\nproblems and less filtration required than point-source\nemitters (drippers). Many spray heads only require the\nreplacement of the orifice to change discharge rate. If\nan orifice becomes plugged, it is easily removed and\ncleaned or replaced. Spray or mini sprinkler head\napplication patterns can be full, half circle, or partial\ncircle (both sides). Figure 6–18 illustrates typical spray\nand mini sprinkler type heads.\nFigure 6–17 \tBasin bubbler system\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\nStake\nBubbler riser\nBuried lateral\nBasin",

Little if any runoff and little evapora-\ntion occur, and deep percolation can be controlled\nwith good water management. Water is applied at the\npoint of use (plant transpiration). Other advantages of\nmicro irrigation systems are:\n• Systems are easily automated with soil moisture\nsensors and computer controlled for low labor\nrequirements.\n• Soil moisture levels can be maintained at prede-\ntermined levels for start-stop operation.\n• Fertilizer can be efficiently added to irrigation\nwater. With proper water management, there is\nminimum waste caused by deep percolation, and\nless opportunity for ground water pollution.\n• Much of the soil surface remains dry, reducing\nweed growth and soil surface evaporation.\n• The soil surface remains firm for use by farm\nworkers and equipment.\n• Frequent irrigations can be used to keep salts in\nthe soil water more diluted and moved away\nfrom plant roots. Irrigation with water of higher\nsalinity is possible (requires a high level of man-\nagement). Where salts are present, soil-water\nmovement must always be toward the edges of\nthe wetted bulb (away from roots). A common\nmistake is to shut the system down when precipi-\ntation occurs, often creating soil-water move-\nment into the plant root zone.\n• Micro irrigation can be used on all terrain and\nmost agricultural crops and soils and is often\nused on steep, rocky ground that is unsuitable\nfor other forms of irrigation.\n• Low tension water availability to plants enhances\ngrowth and improves crop yield and quality.\n(d) Limitations of micro\nirrigation systems\nMicro irrigation is considered expensive to install and\nmaintain. In general, the cost of micro systems is\ngreater than that for sprinkle or surface systems.\nFrequent maintenance is essential, and a high level of\nmanagement is required to obtain optimum application\nefficiencies. Other limitations include:\n• Clogging is a major problem in all micro systems.\nEmitter outlets are very small, and can be easily\nclogged with chemical precipitates, soil particles,\nor organic materials. Clogging can reduce or stop\nwater emission. Chemical treatment of the water\nis often necessary, and filters are almost always\nrequired. Filtration and treatment can be costly,\nespecially where water is taken from surface\nsources containing sediment and debris. During\ninstallation, care should be taken to clean all\nconstruction debris from the inside of pipelines\nas this material can cause plugging.\n• Animals, especially rodents, can damage surface\n(and shallow subsurface) installed plastic pipe\nless than 4 inches in diameter.\n• With low operating pressures, poor distribution\nuniformity can result because of elevation differ-\nences on undulating ground. Pressure regulators\nor pressure compensated emitters are then\nnecessary. However, they require about 2 pounds\nper square inch for operation.\n• On steep terrain, automatic gravity draining of\nlaterals to a low point within the field can cause\nlow distribution uniformity, especially in low\npressure, high volume systems. This problem is\naggravated by frequent on-off cycles, but can be\novercome by installing air-vacuum valves in a\nraised pipe arch (i.e., dog leg) at one or more\nlocations in the lateral. Drains are installed just\nupstream of each pipe arch. This increases the\nnumber of sites affected by lateral pipe drainage,\nthus decreasing effects on distribution unifor-\nmity because each drain discharges less water.",

Salts also concentrate\nbelow the soil surface at the perimeter of the soil\nvolume wetted by each emitter. If the soil dries\nbetween irrigations, reverse movement of soil\nwater can carry salts from the perimeter back\ninto the root zone. To avoid salt damage to roots,\nwater movement must always be away from the\nemitter and from the plant root zone. As strange\nas it may seem, in high soil salinity areas or when\nusing high saline or sodic water for irrigation,\none may need to irrigate when it rains.\n• A smaller volume of soil is wetted at each plant.\nPlants can be quickly stressed if the system fails\n(i.e., pump failure, water source cutoff, pipeline\nor valve failure). Daily checking of the system is\nnecessary even when all or part is automated.\nStoring a 3-day plant-water supply in the soil is\nrecommended along with daily replacement of\nwater used.\n• Multiple emitters at each plant are recommended\nto decrease effects of manufacturer variability, to\nincrease area of root development, and to reduce\nrisk of plant damage should an emitter become\nplugged.\n(e) System components\nSystem components should include the following, in\norder of installation starting at the water source point\n(see fig. 6–19).\n1. \tPrescreening of debris and settling of coarse\nsediments if source is surface water.

Well and surface water\noften contain high concentrations of undesirable\nminerals (chemicals). Surface water can contain\norganic debris, algae, moss, bacteria, small creatures,\nweed seeds, and soil particles. Well water can also\ncontain sand.\nVarious forms of algae are in almost all quiet surface\nwater. Sunlight and water high in nutrients encourage\nalgae growth. Algae are hard to remove from laterals\nand emitters once it gets established. The best way to\nhandle algae is to prevent it from forming. Chlorine\ncan be injected at the end of each irrigation cycle to\nhelp prevent algae buildup. Algae growth is especially\na problem where sunlight aids algae growth inside\nwhite plastic pipe that is installed above the ground\nsurface. Black pipe (PE pipe) is not affected because\nsunlight does not penetrate the pipe. White plastic\npipe can be painted with a dark color to help prevent\nsunlight penetrating the pipe and provide some UV\nprotection.\nBacterial slime can plug emitters and small tubing.\nConditions favoring slime growth include pH of 4.5 to\n6, low oxygen level, temperatures greater than 46\ndegrees Fahrenheit, organic matter, dissolved iron and\nmanganese, and hydrogen sulfide. Treatment is by\ninjection of chlorine, sodium hypochlorite (household\nbleach), or calcium hypochlorite (swimming pool\nchloride). Continuous injection of chlorine at 1 ppm is\neffective. Periodic shock treatment with concentra-\ntions of 10 ppm can also be used.\nFigure 6–19 \tMicro system components\nControls\nGauge\nFertilzer\ninjector\nPrimary\nfilter\nValve\nWater source \tSecondary\nfilter\nPressure\nregulator\nSolenoid\nvalve\nFlow\ncontrol\nMain line\nSubmain line\nLateral lines\nwith emitters\nSubmain line\nBackflow\nprevention\nvalve\nPump\nDrain\n(where\nneeded)",

Sodium content may also be high\nenough to be toxic to the plant. Unless well water\ncharacteristics are known, water should be tested for\nEC w and SAR. See chapter 13 of this guide for further\ndiscussion.\nIf water softeners are used in a home water system, do\nnot use the softened water in a micro irrigation sys-\ntem. Large amounts of salt are added to soften the\nwater. Besides not being good for plant growth, salt\nprecipitates at the emitter discharge orifice and tends\nto plug emitters. Attach the micro system into the\nwater system upstream of any water softener.\nWater with relatively high salinity (high EC w), as\ndefined in chapter 13, can sometimes be used with a\nmicro system. A higher soil-moisture level (lower soil-\nwater tension) can help assure water for plant growth\nis readily available. Additional irrigation water keeps\nthe salts leached from the plant root zone. To accom-\nplish this, the soil must have good internal drainage.\nBicarbonate concentrations in water higher than 2.0\nmilliequivalents per liter (meq/L), coupled with a pH\nabove 7.5, and temperatures greater than 70 °F pro-\nmotes scale development (precipitation of mineral\ndeposits). With black plastic pipe placed on the\nground surface and exposed to direct sunlight, the\nwater temperature inside can get quite high. A scale\n(precipitate) is formed inside the walls of the pipe and\nemitters. Injections of acid (food grade phosphoric or\nsulfuric) can be used for cleaning, but will not com-\npletely reclaim partly blocked lines and emitters.\nContinual treatment is usually necessary. Treatment of\nwater before it is used in the system allows precipita-\ntion and collection of the carbonates to occur before\nthey get into the pipe system. Periodic treatment\nwithin the pipe system can dislodge built up scale and\ncause plugging of emitters.\nAnother common problem with well water is high iron\nconcentration, which can result in iron precipitating in\nthe line. This encourages the growth of iron bacteria.\nThe resulting slime can plug emitters. Where iron is\npresent in concentrations of 0.4 ppm or greater, it can\nbe oxidized to form a precipitate. This precipitate\nshould be filtered out before the water enters the\nirrigation system. Table 6–11 displays physical, chemi-\ncal, and biological factors that cause plugging of\nemitters. Table 6–12 displays plugging potential from\nirrigation water used in micro systems.\nSoil particles near 2 micron size tend to stick together\nbecause of physical size, shape, and electric charge.\nUnder very low velocities they can clog emitter ori-\nfices. Flushing the lines regularly and using larger size\nemitters helps prevent clogging. Also using a chemical\ndispersant, such as hexamethaphosphate, can keep\nparticles dispersed so they do not stick together.\nTable 6–13 displays the typical composition and classi-\nfication of water used in micro systems. It should be\nnoted either one, two, or all three factors (physical,\nchemical, and biological) can be present in a micro\nsystem. The designer and irrigator need to know what\nis present in the irrigation water and in what concen-\ntration.",

Properly designed and maintained\nfiltration systems generally protect the system from\nmost clogging. Clogging causes poor water distribu-\ntion, which in turn may damage the crop if emitters\nare plugged for a long time. When the plant(s) shows\nexcessive stress, it is generally too late to correct the\nproblem. Multiple emitters per plant are recom-\nmended. The main causes of clogging are algae, bacte-\nrial slime, precipitate, construction debris, and sedi-\nment. In general, adequate filtration, line flushing, and\nchemical treatment prevent most clogging.\nThe irrigator must see or know when clogging is\noccurring. The capability of the irrigator to observe\noperation of emitters or spray heads is rated as fol-\nlows. The ratings are in order of easiest to see to most\ndifficult to see from a reasonable distance (i.e., from\nthe seat of a small 4-wheel drive RV unit).\nType emitter \tObservation\n1 \tBasin bubblers \tWater bubbling out of the pipe\nand water on the ground\nsurface.\n2 \tSpray heads \tSpray coming from the heads\nand the resulting wetness on\nthe ground surface and plant\nleaves.\n3 \tPoint emitters \tWater dripping out of the\nsuspended above \temitter and the resulting wet-\nground surface \tness on the ground surface.\n4 \tLine source and \tThe line must be picked up to\npoint source \tsee if the emitter is operat-\nemitters lying on \ting.

Raising the\nemitter too high causes the\nflow rate to change.\n5 \tSubsurface or \tGround surface moisture\nburied tubing \tcaused by upward capillary\naction and plant condition\nindicate emitter operation.\nBuried emitters cannot be\nseen, and their replacement is\nmore difficult. The Crop Water\nStress Index Gun (infra red\nthermometer reading) can be\nused to detect plant stress\nbefore it is visible to the eye.\nNote: The only way to be assured whether the emitter\nis discharging near design flow is to check it using a\ncatch can or rain gutter trough device and a stop\nwatch. The operating pressure also needs to be\nchecked. A little ingenuity is often necessary to de-\nvelop catch can devices that collect all the water\ndischarging from an in-line emitter or spray head, and\nto measure operating pressure.\n(3) Filter systems\nAll water must be screened and filtered to some de-\ngree before use in a micro irrigation system. Water\nquality, temperature, flow rate, and emitter orifice size\ndetermine the type of filter. One rule of thumb is to\nselect filters that retain all particles at least a tenth the\ndiameter of the smallest passageway in the system.\nFor example, a 250-micron filter would be used to\nremove all particles passing through a 25 micron\nopening. Ordinary window and door screen approxi-\nmates 8-12 mesh (0.125-0.083 inches).\nSurface water must first be screened to remove or-\nganic debris, weed seeds, small aquatic creatures, and\ncoarse sediment. Self-cleaning screens provide trans-\nportation and storage outside the flow area for debris\nremoved by the screen. When using flow-through\nscreens, debris should remain on the screen surface\nunless mechanically removed or a back-flushing facil-\nity is used. Most wells produce some sand, precipi-\ntates, and particles that can cause emitters to plug.\nThe turbulent fountain screen is effective for screen-\ning out coarse material, and it requires minimum labor\nfor maintenance (fig. 6–20).\nFilters cannot remove dissolved minerals, algae cells,\nor bacteria. The degree of filtration is generally given\nin terms of screen mesh size. The relationship of mesh\nsize to particle size is displayed in table 6–14. Porous\nflexible tubing requires sand bed filters unless water is\nclean.\nFilter types include centrifugal force, graded sand,\ncartridge, disc, and mechanical screens. Sand filters\ncan be backflushed manually or automatically. Car-\ntridge filters are generally replaceable. Relatively low\ncost replaceable cartridge filters can be used for small\nsystems. When properly operated, centrifugal force\nseparators are generally effective down to fine sand\nparticle sizes. Disk filters separate during the\nbackflush cycle.",

A clean well water source\nmay require an 80 to 100 mesh filter. Normally, a 160\nto 200 mesh screen contains particles unable to pass\nthrough most emitters. Generally, the finer the screen\nmesh the faster it plugs up. Two or more filters or a\nlarger screen or filter area increase the time between\ncleaning. Multiple screen or filter systems can be\ncleaned while the system is in operation. Table 6–15\ndisplays filters used in micro irrigation systems.\nSand bed filters use graded sand for the medium,\neither in graduated layers or single sand particles. The\nsize and type of sand determine pore space size, which\ncontrols the degree of filtration. Pore diameter is\nabout a seventh of the sand particle diameter. Com-\nmercial sands generally are designated by number,\nbecoming finer as the number gets larger (table 6–14).\nUnder flow conditions of less than 20 gallons per\nminute per square foot of media surface, commercial\nsands are efficient and have relatively large debris-\nholding capacity.\nTable 6–14 \tParticle size equivalents\nParticle \tMicrons 1/ \tInches \tScreen mesh\nNo. 11 - Granite \t952 \t.037\nNo. 10 - Silica sand \t524 \t.021\nNo. 30 - Silica sand \t335 \t.013\nVery coarse sand \t1000 - 2000 \t.0393 - .0786 \t18 - 10\nCoarse sand \t500 - 1000 \t.0197 - .0393 \t35 - 18\nMedium sand \t250 - 500 \t.0098 - .0197 \t60 - 35\nFine sand \t100 - 250 \t.0039 - .0098 \t160 - 60\nVery fine sand \t50 - 100 \t.0020 - .0039 \t270 - 160\nSilt \t2 - 50 \t.00008 - .0020\nClay \t2 \t< .00008\n1/ 1000 micron = 1 millimeter.\nTable 6–15 \tFilters used for micro irrigation systems\nType \tPractical filtration limit\nSettling basins \tVaries with time and water chemistry (usually 100%\nof 40 micron size and larger particles settle in 1 hr)\nSand separators \tTo 74 microns\nScreen filters \tTo 74 microns\nSand bed filters \tTo 25 microns\nCartridge filters \tTo 25 microns\nDisc filters \tTo 25 microns",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation System Design\tChapter 6\n6–73\t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nSand filters are cleaned by backwashing (backflush-\ning). Backwashing can be done automatically on a\ntimed cycle, at a specified pressure drop across the\nfilter, or manually. Facilities must be available to\nreceive, store, and dispose backwash water, sediment,\nand debris. Periodic chemical treatment may be neces-\nsary to control algae in the filter bed.\nDisc filter elements consist of flat, grooved rings\nresembling poker chips with a hole in the center. A\nstack of rings forms a cylindrical filtering body. Grade\nof filtration (400 to 25 microns) depends on the size\nand number of grooves in the individual grooved rings.\nThe rings are held tightly together with a compressed\nspring.\nThe filtration process takes place throughout the\nentire cylinder volume (stacked rings). Water flow\ndirection is from outside the cylinder toward the\ncenter. When properly sized (flow capacity wise) and\nwith larger than 140 mesh screening, head losses\nthrough the disc cylinders are relatively low. Manufac-\nturer recommended minimum operating pressures are\nin the range of 30 pounds per square inch, with maxi-\nmum operating pressures of 100 to 200 pounds per\nsquare inch, depending on model. Backflush water (at\ntypical pressures of 40 to 50 lb/in 2) allows the disc to\nseparate and flush out the collected soil and debris\nparticles that have been caught in the grooves.\nA filter is one of the most important components of a\nmicro irrigation system and must be kept clean to be\neffective. Monitoring line pressure at filter inlet and\ndischarge points helps check performance and signal a\nchange occurring in the filter.\n(4) Soil moisture distribution\nMicro irrigation normally wets only a part of the\npotential plant root zone in a soil. In arid areas, crop\nroot development is generally limited to that volume of\nsoil wetted from the emitter system. For agricultural\ncrops, typically half to three-fourths of the potential\nroot development area is wetted (irrigated). For\nlandscape plantings, individual plants are irrigated.\nThe volume of soil wetted is a function of the emitter\ntype, emitter discharge, distance between emitters,\ntime of set, and soil texture. Distribution and extent of\nsoil wetting should be a major consideration in the\ndesign of any micro irrigation system. For medium and\nfine textured soils, wetted area width from a point\nsource is generally equal to or greater than wetted\ndepth. With coarse textured soils, wetted width is less\nthan wetted depth; therefore, more emitters are neces-\nsary to obtain adequate irrigation for root develop-\nment.\nThe ability of a plant to resist dislodging by wind is\ndetermined by root development (typically plant root\nzone wetted pattern). This is especially the case in arid\nareas, and to some extent in all areas. Table 6–16\ncompares wetted diameter and area for various soil\ntextures. A full surface area cover crop is difficult to\nmaintain in an arid environment if less than complete\nsurface area irrigation coverage is provided.\n(5) Distribution lines\nThe micro irrigation distribution system is a network\nof pipes, tubing, and valves. Generally, mainlines carry\nwater from the pump to a system of submains.\nSubmains then carry the water to headers (manifolds)\nand then into laterals or feeder lines. Mainlines and\nsubmains are generally buried PVC plastic pipe. Fit-\ntings are cemented or use O-ring gaskets for water\ntightness. Submains can also be flexible tubing either\nburied or laid on the ground surface. Mainlines and\nsubmains are typically buried to provide access and\nlimit potential equipment damage. Laterals or feeder\nlines are normally 3/8- to 3/4-inch-diameter polyethyl-\nene (PE) flexible tubing either buried or laid on the\nground surface. Lateral fittings generally are slip joint\nwith hose clamps for water tightness. In some areas\nrodents and small animals (i.e., coyotes, squirrels) will\ndamage PE pipe that is less than 4 inches in diameter.\nTable 6–16 \tDiameter and area of soil wetted by a single\nemitter with no restrictive horizons\nSoil \tWetted \tWetted\ntexture \tdiameter \tarea\n(ft) \t(ft 2)\nCoarse \t2 - 4 \t4 - 12\nMedium \t4 - 5 \t12 - 20\nFine \t5 - 7 \t40 - 60",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation System Design\tChapter 6\n6–74 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\n(6) Emitter application\nThe discharge (emitter) device is unique to a micro\nirrigation system. Many types, shapes, and discharge\nranges are commercially available. They can be either\npressure compensating or noncompensating.\nDischarge devices can be divided into two general\ncategories based on field application: line-source and\npoint-source. Point-source include microspray or\nsprinkler heads, microtubing, and bubbler systems.\nManufacturers of emitter devices can furnish perfor-\nmance data that show discharge versus pressure for\neach size and kind of emitter manufactured. Section\n652.0605 includes additional discussion of specific\nemitters that are commercially available.\nLine-source emitters are used for closely spaced row\ncrops, such as vegetables, cotton, sugarcane, grapes,\nstrawberries, melons, and some small fruit. These\nemitters are either a series of equally spaced orifices\nalong a single or double chamber tube, or they are\nsmall openings in porous tubing. Closely spaced bur-\nied line source emitter tubing has been shown to be\neffective in small areas of turf, especially where sur-\nface spray is not desirable.\nThe discharge rate of line-source emitters is in gallons\nper hour or gallons per minute per unit length of tubing\n(gpm/100 ft, or gph/ft). The emitter or orifice spacing\naffects the location and amount of water delivered to\neach plant. Operating pressures range from 5 to 30\npounds per square inch. Line source emitters should be\nused on nearly level ground and can be installed on the\nground surface or as buried feeder lines.\nPoint-source emitters are used for windbreaks, fruit,\ncitrus and nut orchards, grapes, cane berries, blueber-\nries, bananas, ornamental and landscape shrubs,\nnursery stock, and greenhouse crops. The point-source\nemitter is an individual emitter typically attached to 1/\n4- to 3/4-inch-diameter PE flexible tubing. Orifice flow\nrates vary from a half gallon per hour for drippers, 30\ngallons per hour for spray heads, and 1 gallon per\nminute for basin bubbler devices.\n(7) Miscellaneous control devices\n• Gate valves provide on-off control. They can be\noperated manually or with timed or automatic\nsolenoid valves.\n• Pressure regulating valves control pressure\nwithin desired limits of emitter discharge.\n• Vacuum relief valves prevent soil particles from\nentering the system when negative pressures\ndevelop (i.e., the system is shut off).\n• Pressure gages monitor pressures in the system.\n• Flushing valves discharge collected sediment and\nother debris.\n• Drain valves drain water from the system.\n• Injectors add chemicals (fertilizers, acid, chlo-\nrine).\n• Flow measuring devices monitor how much\nwater is applied.\n(8) Fertilizing\nThe application of plant nutrients through a micro\nirrigation system is convenient and efficient. Several\ninjectors are commercially available. Nitrogen can be\ninjected in the forms of anhydrous ammonia, aqua\nammonia, ammonium phosphate, urea, ammonium\nnitrate, and calcium nitrate. Some chemicals may\nchange the pH in the water, thereby affecting other\nchemicals in the water. Phosphorus is usually added in\nacid form. Potassium can be added as potassium\nsulfate, potassium chloride, and potassium nitrate.\nOther micronutrients can be added, but may react with\nsalts in irrigation water resulting in precipitation. Care\nshould be taken so the injected nutrients don’t react\nwith other chemicals in the water to cause precipita-\ntion and plugging.\n(9) Costs\nEquipment, filtration, control, and numerous laterals\nneeded for a micro system generally result in a high\ncost per acre. Per acre costs are highly influenced by\nfiltration costs. For example filtration requirements\nare relatively the same for 20 acres as for 40 acres.\nAdequate filtration cannot be overstressed. Because of\nreduced filtration requirement and number of laterals,\nbasin bubbler and spray systems can be more eco-\nnomical, especially for orchards and landscaping.\n(10) Maintenance\nFrequent maintenance is essential to keep emitters\nfunctioning at design flow. Maintenance items include:\n• Clean or backflush filters when needed.\n• Flush lateral lines regularly.\n• Check emitter discharge often; replace as neces-\nsary.\n• Check operating pressures often; a pressure drop\n(or rise) may indicate problems.",

Inject liquid\nfertilizers when needed.\n• Service pumps regularly.\n(11) Automation\nMicro irrigation systems can be operated fully auto-\nmatic, semiautomatic, or manually. A time clock or\nprogrammed control panel can be installed to operate\nsolenoid valves, to start and stop the irrigation, and to\ncontrol each submain and lateral. This degree of\nautomatic control is simple, the parts are readily\navailable, and it effectively controls the desired\namount of water to be applied. A manual priority\nswitch that can override clock or control panel\nswitches is desirable to postpone or add irrigations. A\nfully automatic system, using soil moisture sensors to\nprovide the triggering mechanism to start an irrigation,\nis also simple to install and operate. Several sensors\nmay be needed, depending on soils and rooting depth\nof crops to be grown. Where water supply is adequate\noverirrigation is the biggest water management prob-\nlem with automated systems.\n(g) Design procedures\nThe primary objective of good micro irrigation system\ndesign and management is to provide sufficient system\ncapacity to adequately meet crop-water needs. Unifor-\nmity of application depends on the uniformity of\nemitter discharge, system maintenance, and elevations\nof the ground surface. Nonuniform discharge is caused\nby pressure differentials from friction loss, plugging,\nelevation change, and manufacturing variability. Using\npressure compensating emitters somewhat alleviates\nthe elevation change and pressure differential prob-\nlem. Using multiple emitters for a single shrub, vine,\nplant, or tree helps to compensate for manufacturing\nvariability and minimize plant damage that results\nfrom plugged or malfunctioning emitters.\nThe designer of a micro irrigation system must make a\nrational choice about the duration of application, the\nnumber of emitters per plant, specific type of emitter\ndevice(s), and the discharge per emitter to provide the\nmost effective irrigation. In most situations the re-\nquired water volume (or rate) to irrigate a specific\ncrop is less than that required by other irrigation\nmethods; thus the minimum system capacity require-\nment is not a limiting factor if adequate water was\navailable for other irrigation methods.\n(1) Water management\nProper water management when using micro irrigation\nis essential to avoid excessive water use. The ease of\napplying an irrigation, especially under manual con-\ntrol, brings a mentality of when in doubt irrigate.\nDeep percolation, typically the result of overirrigation,\ncannot be seen. As a result, overirrigation is by far the\nbiggest problem with users of micro irrigation. Field\napplication efficiencies are often measured in the mid\n60 percent, while most micro irrigation systems are\ndesigned assuming application efficiencies of more\nthan 90 percent. The irrigation system designer needs\nto have realistic expectations of water management\nskills and desires of the user.\n(2) Duration of application\nThe least cost per acre is generally achieved by the\nsystem having the longest duration or lowest flow rate\nand smallest pipe sizes. The duration for application is\ninfluenced by the overall irrigation schedule and by\nincorporating a factor of safety in the design. Applica-\ntion time must be sufficient to apply the water that has\nbeen consumed since the previous irrigation. Ideally,\ncontinuous or demand delivery of irrigation water\nprovides the lowest cost design and best irrigation\nscheduling opportunity. Therefore, the duration of\neach irrigation can be determined after the following\nare known:\n• Gallons of water needed per plant per day to\nmeet evapotranspiration.\n• Desired interval between irrigations (frequency\nof irrigation).\n• Application rate per emitter or unit length.\nHours operation per irrigation are determined by:\nGallons of water per plant per day\nApplication rate per plant in gallons per hour\nGallons of water needed per day per plant are calcu-\nlated using the evapotranspiration rate of the plant(s),\nsoil MAD level, and AWC of the planned soil volume.\nEven if water used by an individual plant is to be\nreplaced daily, a 3-day water supply be stored in the\nplant root zone to is recommended provide water\nwhen irrigation system discharge is interrupted. If the\nsystem operates less frequently than daily, increase",

Time is needed for general maintenance, break-\ndowns, and to provide a factor of safety during ex-\ntreme high plant water use periods. Using more emit-\nters of the same discharge rate with less duration is\ngenerally better than fewer emitters with greater\ncapacity.\n(3) Discharge per emitter\nDrip emitters are mechanical devices designed to\noperate at low pressure (2 to 20 lb/in 2) from 0.5 gallon\nper hour to nearly 0.5 gallon per minute. Discharge\nrates of line source emitters are in units of gallons per\nhour per foot or gallons per minute per 100 feet. Dis-\ncharge rate should be within plus or minus 15 percent\nof the average system flow rate.\n(4) Number of emitters\nMicro irrigation requires a decision be made about the\npercentage of potential rooting volume to be watered.\nIt is recommended at least 40 to 50 percent of the area\nunder a tree, plant, or shrub drip line (at mature size)\nreceive moisture. Part of this requirement comes from\nproviding an anchor system to support the plant. Plant\nroots do not normally develop where the soil is dry;\ni.e., water tension is 15 bars (atmospheres) or greater.\nAn onsite test may be needed to determine vertical\nand lateral movement of water from a point source.\nTypically in uniform fine to medium textured soils, the\nwetted width is equal to the wetted depth. In coarse\ntextured soils, the wetted width is typically no more\nthan half the wetted depth.\nEmitters should be spaced equidistant around the\nshrub or tree and should be located within a third of\nthe distance from the trunk to the drip line. With line\nsource emitters, 12- to 36-inch spacing is typical. In\ncoarse textured soils, line source emitters should be\nspaced less than 12 inches apart, and medium textured\nsoils less than 24 inches. Emitter spacing also depends\non plant type and density.\nMicrospray or sprinkler heads provide the largest\nwetted soil volume. A minimum of two application\ndevices should be used per shrub or tree. Figure 6–21\ndisplays alternative ways to layout emitters for indi-\nvidual trees.\n(5) Laterals or feeder lines\nMost lateral or feeder lines are flexible PE plastic\ntubing. Emitter devices are either attached directly to\nthe pipe or the pipe may contain built-in orifices.\nSurface installed tubing is subject to damage from\nanimals, rodents, and field operating equipment. The\ndesigner should be guided to size laterals so that\ndischarge differences are kept to less than 10 percent\nbetween the first and last emitter on the line. Even\nthough pressure compensating emitters may be used,\nlateral friction loss must be evaluated to help assure\nminimum pressures are maintained for proper emitter\n(and regulator) operation. Table 6–17 displays maxi-\nmum pressure variation for typical emitters.\nMost micro systems are divided into subunits con-\nnected by manifolds through control valves to a\nsubmain or mainline that feeds several laterals. The\ntotal pressure variation in both the manifold and\nlaterals must be considered when sizing pipelines. In\nan optimum design, the total pressure loss in the\nsubunit should be equally divided between the mani-\nfold and the laterals. For example, if a total of 4\npounds per square inch pressure variation is allowed,\n2 pounds per square inch can be lost in the manifold\nand 2 in the laterals.\nFigure 6–21 \tAlternative emitter layout\n(a) \t(b)\n(c)",

Laterals or feeder\nlines need to be installed as nearly level as possible.\nOn sloping fields submains and mainlines should be\ninstalled up and down the slope. A 5-foot elevation\nchange represents over 2 pounds per square inch\npressure change, which can change emitter discharge\nmore than the allowable 10 percent in low pressure\nsystems.\nTo maintain uniform pressure at outlets to laterals the\ndesigner should consider the following:\n• Divide the submains into shorter lengths or off\nbalance the outlets so less than a 10-foot drop is\npresent between inlet from the mainline and\nlowest outlet to a lateral pipeline.\n• Install pressure regulators at each outlet to\nlaterals.\n• Install flow regulators at each outlet to laterals.\n• Use pressure compensating emitters where\nneeded.\n• Size submains and laterals to reduce and some-\ntimes nearly eliminate friction losses.\n• Provide adequate pressure to operate pressure\nand flow regulators at design discharge.\n(7) Other\nWhen planning, the designer must determine total\nirrigation system needs.

Lateral emitter spacings\nor capacities may vary with each row, which can\nrequire a separate design for each lateral. Drought\ntolerance should be developed over several months or\nyears by encouraging deeper root development pat-\nterns. Longer, less frequent irrigations encourage\ndeeper root development. Design methods in NEH,\npart 623, (section 15), chapter 7, can be used when the\npurpose of the system is to irrigate a windbreak\nthroughout its life. Chapter 4, Irrigation Water Require-\nments, and the state supplement of this guide provide\nlocal water requirements for shrubs and trees.\nWhen establishment of the windbreak is the objective,\nthe following additional factors must be considered:\nThe system should be designed to last up to 5\nyears. Usually the distribution pipelines can be laid on\nthe surface, although surface installations may make it\ndifficult to use farm equipment for weed control.\nPotential rodent and wildlife damage should also be a\nconsideration as to whether the distribution lines are\non the surface or buried.\nOnce plants are established, water application\nshould be timed to apply a larger quantity of\nwater less frequently. This encourages deep rooting.\nAugering a deep small diameter hole (post hole\nsize) below each tree or shrub and backfilling the\nhole with local soil disrupts horizontal soil re-\nstrictions. This action helps move applied water\ndeeper and encourages deep rooting.\nIn arid and semiarid areas, water application\nshould be made in the spring as early as possible\nafter the soil has thawed. This helps fill the entire\nsoil profile to field capacity.\nFigure 6–23 \tTypical windbreak layout\nMain line\nWell or water source\nControl valve\nFilter\nPressure regulator\nLateral line \tLateral line",

This helps ensure hardening\noff for winter. The lines should be drained.\nTo establish windbreaks in areas where precipi-\ntation can supply the needed water, irrigation\nneeds to be discontinued after the plants are\nwell established. This may require one or two sum-\nmers of controlled tapering off. Less frequent applica-\ntions of longer duration can encourage deeper root\ndevelopment.\nDo not provide full irrigation to the plants. Use\nonly the minimum amount of water necessary to\nproduce healthy plant growth. Slower growth helps\nprovide a stronger shrub or tree. Check soil moisture\nperiodically with a hand probe. Once irrigation starts,\nplants should not be put into excessive stress for lack\nof moisture. Encourage rooting in nonirrigated areas\nby managing precipitation as a water source.\nMicro irrigation systems used strictly for windbreak\nestablishment require fewer emitters than systems\nused in mature stands. Emitters can be added as the\nshrubs and trees grow and mature, but the system\nmust be designed to provide adequate capacity. The\nsize of the laterals, submains, and mains should be\ndesigned to deliver adequate water to mature stands.\nThe following information is a guide to the number of\nemitters required in a medium to fine texture soil.\nTypically in coarse soils, it is better to use several low\ndischarge emitters evenly spaced around the shrub or\ntree. On-time can be adjusted to provide the desired\nwetted depth and lateral water movement in the soil.\nLow shrubs \tOne or two \tPlaced 6 to 12\n2 to 3 feet tall \t1-gph emitters \tinches from\nbase of plant.\nShrubs or trees \tTwo or three \tPlaced 12\nto 5 feet tall \t1-gph emitters \tinches from\nbase of plant.\nShrubs or trees \tThree to four \tEqually spaced\n5 to 10 feet tall \t1-gph emitters, \t2 to 3 feet from\nor one or two \tbase of plant.\n2-gph emitters\nTrees \tFour to six \tEqually spaced\n>10 feet tall \t1-gph emitters, \tabout 4 to 8 feet\nor two or three \tfrom trunk.

A post hole sized auger can be\nused for most shrubs. Backfill material will be free of\nhorizontal soil layers caused by compaction and soil\ngradation (typically present in most water and wind\ndeposited soils). Plant the tree or shrub near or in the\nhole, then locate an emitter at the top of the backfilled\nhole. Once the plant is established, irrigate with long\nduration, less frequent applications. Water will move\ndown the disturbed soil profile. Developing roots will\nfollow the irrigation water in the disturbed hole down\nto the water table. Long-term nonirrigated successful\nriparian vegetation (trees and shrubs) can be estab-\nlished 15 to 20 feet above a water source.",

A water\ntable management system can lower an existing water\ntable, maintain an existing water table, or raise a water\ntable to a desirable elevation. A water table is gener-\nally held at a constant elevation during a crop growing\nseason, but can be fluctuated. Water from a water\ntable is supplied to plant roots by upward capillary\nwater movement through the soil profile, also referred\nto as upflux. Water table is controlled by:\n• Providing subsurface drainage to lower or main-\ntain an existing water table, or by removing\nwater from the soil profile using buried laterals.\n• Providing controlled drainage by capturing\nrainfall to raise a water table to a desired eleva-\ntion at or above the buried laterals.\n• Introducing irrigation water via a buried lateral\nsystem to raise or maintain a water table at\ndesired elevation at or above the buried laterals.\n(1) Primary objectives of a water table man-\nagement system\n• Provide for trafficability of the soil surface for\ntimely use of farm equipment.\n• Reduce crop stress caused by excess water in\nthe plant root zone.\n• Reduce crop stress caused by deficiency of\navailable soil moisture in the plant root zone.\n• Provide a better root development environment\nin the soil.\n• Minimize harmful offsite environmental pollu-\ntion.\n• Maximize use of rainfall.\n• Minimize need for additional irrigation water.\n• Control salinity.\n(2) Advantages\n• Permits storage of water in lower part of soil\nprofile.\n• Reduces need for pumping irrigation water for\nmeeting crop water requirements.\n• Can incorporate a subirrigation lateral system\nwith a subsurface drainage lateral system with\nlow additional cost.\n• Reduces drainage pumping costs if required.\n• Can be relatively easy to automate control of\nwater levels in control structures.\n• Captures plant nutrients at or near the water\ntable for future use by plants.\n(3) Disadvantages\n• Labor intensive to manually adjust the elevation\nof weirs in water control structures to change\nfrom drainage mode to irrigation mode.\n• Labor intensive to set and readjust automatic\nwater level controlled mechanisms in water\ncontrol structures. However, labor is minimal\nonce they are adequately set.\n• Total system costs can be relatively high in soils\nthat have low hydraulic conductivity and are in\nhigh rainfall areas with undulating topography.\n• Water quality must be high.\n• In saline areas, an intensive salt content monitor-\ning and management program is required to\nprevent excessive long-term upward movement\nand accumulation of damaging salts. Salt-tolerant\ncrops can be effectively irrigated with saline\nwater from a shallow water table, but where low\nsalt-tolerant crops are included in the cropping\nrotation, downward movement of salts at some\ntime may be required. The latter would require\nusing excess irrigation water for leaching of\nsalts, thus requiring free drainage. Offsite envi-\nronmental pollution can occur where drainage\neffluent high in salts is allowed to enter surface\nwater.",

In the\ndrainage mode, laterals discharge into a system of\ncollectors or submains that outlet into mains. In the\nirrigation mode, flow is then reversed. Figure 6–24\ndisplays a schematic of typical water management\nsystem with subsurface drainage laterals used for\ndrainage or subirrigation. Separate systems for irriga-\ntion and drainage are encouraged for maximum effi-\nciency.\nThe size, spacing, and depth of laterals are a function\nof soil hydraulic conductivity, desired elevation of\nwater table in relation to ground surface (depth),\navailable flow from soil mass to and from pipelines,\navailable hydraulic gradient of laterals, and desirable\ntime to reach a planned water table elevation. The size\nof submains and mains are a function of soil hydraulic\nconductivity and area served, lateral layout, discharge\nto and from laterals, and available hydraulic gradient\nof submains and mains.\nAlthough separate subirrigation and drainage systems\nare more efficient, dual purpose systems are often\nused. Dual purpose systems generally require resetting\nslide gates and flashboards when changing from\ndrainage to irrigation or irrigation to drainage modes;\nsometimes several times each growing season.\nEach lateral (or group of laterals) requires a water\ntable control structure in or near the submain. The\nwater table control structure can be set manually or\nautomatically to either allow free drainage or to estab-\nlish a water table elevation upstream of the structure.\nIrrigation intake structures are vertical pipes located\nin submains that simply allow input of irrigation water\nat the ground surface from an external water source.\nIn the irrigation mode, water flows from the submains\ninto the laterals and then out of the laterals into the\nsoil. External water is supplied when rainfall does not\nmaintain the desired water table elevation.\nThe most common pipe material for buried laterals is\ncorrugated polyethylene plastic pipe (CPP). It can be\ninstalled either as perforated or nonperforated tubing\npreferably using laser grade controlled trenching and\ninstallation equipment.\n(c) Planning and design consider-\nations\n(1) Controls\nWater table elevation is commonly controlled by a\nmanually adjusted weir for a group of laterals where\nsubmains discharge into the main. When excessive\nrainfall occurs, the water level in the control structure\nis lowered to allow free flow through the structure.\nThis allows the drainage system to remove excess\nwater more quickly.\nThe operator must decide when to raise or reset the\nweir to allow the water table to reestablish itself at the\ndesirable height. If done too early the water table is\nheld too high, and if done too late the water will have\ndrained, thereby losing valuable water.\nOne solution is to provide an automatic water level\ncontrol system. Float controlled valves can be used in\nplace of the manually adjusted weir. When excessive\nrainfall events cause drainage outflow, the float\nmechanism opens a drain valve. As drainage outflow\nFigure 6–24 \tTypical water table management system\n\u0000\u0000\t\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\nDepression storage\nDrainage\nRunoff\ninfiltration\nSubirrigation\nDeep seepage\tRestrictive layer\nWater table\nSoil surface\nRainfall or plant ET",

To maintain the water table at the de-\nsired elevation during periods of expected rainfall, it\nmay be desirable to lower the controlled water table\nelevation 3 to 6 inches. This will increase available\nsoil-water storage and allow the float controlled\nmechanism to discharge larger volumes of water\nduring or immediately after heavy rainfall events.\n(2) Upward water flow\nUpward water flow (up flux) rate is a function of soil\nproperties, primarily texture, and water table depth.\nUpward flow rate is generally most significant for\nmedium textured soils where the hydraulic gradient\nand hydraulic conductivity together produce a usable\nrate of water supply.\nFigure 6–25 displays water table contribution to meet\nirrigation requirements as a function of soil type and\nwater table depth. For a sandy loam soil to meet a\ncrop ET rate of 0.2 inch per day in a steady state\nupward flow condition, the water table needs to be\nheld at about a 2-foot depth. However, with either clay\nor sand, the water table depth needs to be about 0.5\nfoot. Additional details are provided in NEH, Part 623\n(Section 15), Chapter 2, Irrigation Water Require-\nments. Also refer to section 652.0605 for local data on\nsoils versus upward flow rate characteristics.\n(3) Installation\nInstallation of buried drainage pipe can be accom-\nplished with a variety of equipment and labor includ-\ning:\n• Laser grade controlled trenching or plow-in\nequipment with continuous placement of CPP\ndrainage tubing, with or without filter or enve-\nlope material.\n• Laser or nonlaser controlled trenching equip-\nment with hand installed CPP drainage tubing,\nclay or concrete tile, and semirigid perforated\nplastic or perforated steel pipe.\n• Backhoe type equipment with hand installed CPP\ndrainage tubing, clay or concrete tile, and semi-\nrigid perforated plastic or perforated steel pipe.\nMost common buried drainage pipe is corrugated\npolyethylene plastic pipe (CPP) tubing. However,\nconcrete and clay tile or perforated PVC plastic or\nsteel pipe can be used. With concrete and clay tile, the\njoints are butted together with no gaskets. Protection\nis needed to prevent soil particle movement into the\npipeline at the open joints. When water is introduced\ninto a subsurface irrigation system (buried conduits),\nvelocities through the perforations or joints are typi-\ncally higher than those in the drainage mode. The\nhigher velocities can dislodge soil particles that can\nthen move into the conduit in the drainage mode.\nDepending on soil characteristics, flow rate and veloc-\nity, opening size, and configuration in the buried\nconduit, filters, and envelope material may be needed.\nSee NEH, Section 16, Drainage, or the local drainage\nguide for additional details on filter and envelope\ndesign criteria.\n(d) Design procedures\nIn many areas design procedures and criteria are\nbased on local field experience. Retrofitting of exist-\ning subsurface drainage systems to water table man-\nagement systems typically involves the installation of\nwater table control structures. The area to be\nsubirrigated will closely coincide with the area\ndrained. To assure full field coverage, additional\nburied laterals may need to be installed for subirriga-\ntion laterals.\nNRCS has supported the development of computer\nmodels to assist with planning, design, and operation\nof water table management systems. These models\ninclude DRAINMOD and SI-DESIGN.\n(1) DRAINMOD\nThis computer model was developed by North Caro-\nlina State University (Richard “Wayne” Skaggs) with\nNRCS support. DRAINMOD is a simulation model that\ncharacterizes responses in a soil-water regime to\nvarious combinations of subsurface and surface water\nmanagement operations. It can predict the response of\na water table and soil water movement above a water\ntable to rainfall, crop ET, various degrees of subsur-\nface and surface drainage, and the use of water table\ncontrol. It was originally intended for use mostly in\nhumid areas, but can be used anywhere historical\nhourly rainfall data are available. Soil parameters for\nuse in the model are developed by the computer\nprogram, DMSOILS.",

Irrigation water\nshould be conveyed as economically, efficiently, and\nsafely as possible without excessive losses or erosion.\nWater should be delivered to the plant at a suitable\nquality for the planned purpose. All components of a\nfarm irrigation water delivery system must be sized to\nfurnish adequate irrigation water to meet planned crop\nuse or scheduled delivery from an irrigation district. If\nwater is delivered on a rotation or turn basis, the\nsystem must be large enough to allow delivery of\nwater in the time allowed. Plans should provide for\nfuture needs and expansion. Figure 7–1 displays a\ntypical multifield delivery system for various irrigation\nmethods and systems.\nSizing a system to meet peak (or planned) period crop\nwater use requires careful consideration of many\nalternatives and compromises. They involve ditch and\npipe size, pump size, labor considerations, capital\ninvestment, operating costs, available water capacity\nof soils, crop rotations, plant stress risk levels, and\noverall management of the farm enterprise.

This is especially true in humid and\nsemihumid areas where a substantial part of plant\nwater need is provided by rainfall.\nFarm distribution components (facilities) include all\nnecessary appurtenances, such as water control struc-\ntures, slide gates, trash racks, screening devices, water\nmeasuring devices, flow control valves, air release\nvalves, vacuum relief valves, pressure regulating or\nrelief valves, controllable flow turnouts and drains,\nplus other components necessary for the long-term\noperation and maintenance of the system. All facilities\nshould be located so they interfere as little as possible\nwith farming operations. Components of the distribu-\ntion system should be readily accessible for operation\nand maintenance. An operation and maintenance plan\nshould be provided as part of the system plan or\ndesign.\nWater delivery should be adaptable to meet specific\ncrop water needs for each irrigation system used.\nBasic components of distribution systems include\npipelines, unlined and lined open ditches, water con-\ntrol structures, water measurement devices, tailwater\nrecovery and reuse facilities, system automation,\npumping plants, surface drainage systems, and chemi-\ncal storage, injection and transport facilities.\nDesign criteria, procedures, friction loss tables and\ncharts, and design examples are provided in many\nNatural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)\nreferences. These references include National Engi-\nneering Handbook (NEH) Part 634 (Section 3), Hy-\ndraulics; NEH Part 623 (Section 15), Irrigation; Na-\ntional Engineering Field Handbook, Chapters 3, Hy-\ndraulics, and 15, Irrigation; and several design notes\nand technical releases. Many programmable calculator\nand computer programs are also available to assist in\nthe design of pipelines, open ditches, and pumping\nplants. References, tools, and programs most com-\nmonly used are included in 652.0710, State Supple-\nment, and in Chapter 15, Resource Planning and\nEvaluation Tools and Worksheets.\n652.0701 \tPipelines\nPipeline delivery systems can be pumped or gravity\nflow and consist of buried pipe, surface installed pipe,\nor both. A buried pipe can extend from a water source\nto the farm and to individual fields with surface pipe\nused for distribution within the field. Buried pipe can\nalso extend into fields as a field main (or submain) and\nhave risers and valves appropriately spaced to deliver\nwater to surface ditches, portable water conveyance\npipelines, gated pipe, or sprinkler laterals.\n(a) Typical pipe installation and\nmaterials for irrigation sys-\ntems\n(1) Culverts\nCulverts are generally short pipe sections where\npartial pipe flow conditions exist.\nTypical use includes:\n• Equipment crossings in open channels (canals,\nlaterals, ditches)\n• Water control structures with flow control gate\ninstallation\n• Water measuring\nMaterials are generally galvanized steel or aluminum\ncorrugated pipe; PVC plastic pipe; corrugated PE\n(regular or smooth bore) plastic pipe; and reinforced\nor nonreinforced concrete pipe.\n(2) Gravity pipelines\nGenerally gravity pressure pipelines are longer pipe\nsections where full pipe flow, partial pipe flow, or a\ncombination of both conditions exist. They rely on\nelevation drop to provide sufficient hydraulic gradient\nfor flow to occur. Gravity pipelines are used to trans-\nport water in a conveyance or distribution system, or\nfrom a source to point of use, as buried or surface,\npermanent or portable pipes. Typical use includes:\n• Water conveyance pipelines to reduce seepage\nand evaporation losses, prevent erosion, or\nprovide control of water delivery.\n• Inverted siphons to replace flumes or to cross\nlow areas including gullies.\n• Gated pipe to distribute water into furrows.\n• Pipelines to provide gravity pressure for sprin-\nkler or micro irrigation systems.",

Generally longer sections are used where full\npipe flow conditions exist and shorter sections where\nwater is pumped from a source (pond, canal, stream,\nwell) to an open ditch that is close by. A pump is used\nto provide adequate pressure head to overcome eleva-\ntion and pipe and fitting friction losses. Pipelines can\nbe permanent or portable. They are used to transport\nwater in a conveyance and distribution system or from\nsource to point of use. Typical use includes:\n• Pipe within a pumping plant system that lifts\nwater from source to open ditch or field.\n• Conveyance and distribution system.\n• Pipelines to contain pressurized flows for use in\nsprinkler and micro irrigation systems.\nMaterials are generally welded steel, galvanized steel,\naluminum, or plastic.\n(b) Specific applications\nGated pipe is a surface portable pipe (generally PVC or\naluminum) used to distribute controlled flows to\nfurrows at very low pressure head (< 1 to 2 lb/in 2).\nDisposable, thin wall (7 or 10 mil), lay-flat PE pipe is\nalso available. Its use is generally limited to 1 or 2\nyears. With the pipeline filled with water, a hand\npunch mounted on a handle, approximately 2 feet\nlong, is moved in an arc to create holes (or gates) at\neach furrow. Hole sizes are selected to discharge\npredetermined amounts of water at each furrow,\nbased on head available in the pipeline. Pipeline\ngrades can be established where only two or three\nhole sizes are necessary in a quarter-mile pipeline.\nMaximum head (pressure) in lay-flat PE pipe must be\nless than 10 feet (4 psi).\nGated pipe can be used in place of an open head ditch\nat the upper end of a field. It is also well suited to use\nin place of an intermediate temporary head ditch on\nfields too long to be irrigated in one length of run.\nSocks or other devices attached to each gate help to\nreduce exit velocities; thereby minimizing erosion at\nthe head of furrows. The degree the gates are opened\naccurately regulates water flow to each furrow. Where\nwater source to the gated pipe is from open ditches,\nscreening for debris removal may be necessary to\nprevent plugging of gate openings. Gated pipe is used\nin cablegation and surge systems. Once gated pipe is\ninstalled at the head of the fields for the duration of\nthe irrigation season and the gates are adjusted, addi-\ntional labor is rarely necessary.\nThe most common problem with gated pipe is having\nexcess pressure head. Excess pressure head acceler-\nates pipeline leakage at the joints and furrow erosion\nimmediately downstream of gates. Easy to install\ndevices are available to reduce pressure head. These\ncan be installed inside the pipe as controllable low\nhead gates or outside the pipe as flow-through stands\nor boxes.\nWhen disposable PE pipe is used, the pipeline is laid\nout, filled with water, and predetermined sized holes\npunched for each irrigated furrow. When reinforced\nPVC lay-flat pipe is used, adjustable gates can be\ninserted in the holes. Typically two or more hole sizes\nare required across the field to deliver a design flow\nrate to each furrow (or border strip). Very low pres-\nsure head is used in the pipelines, thus friction loss\nand elevation differences become critical.",

These ditches should be of adequate size\nand installed on nonerosive grades. Small, inadequate\nditches that do not have proper water control struc-\ntures and maintenance probably are the source of\nmore trouble and consume more time in operating a\nsurface irrigation system than any other cause.\nOpen channels that carry irrigation water from a\nsource to one or more farms are typically referred to\nas canals and laterals; and are generally permanent\ninstallations. Field or farm ditches convey and distrib-\nute water from the source of supply (canals, laterals,\nwells) to a field(s) within a farm. Most are permanent\ninstallations except where they are used within a long\nfield to shorten length of runs, where excessive sedi-\nment is in irrigation water, or where crop rotations\nrequire differing field layouts. In these cases they are\ninstalled at planting time and removed before or\nfollowing harvest.\nHead ditches are used to distribute water across the\nhigh end of a field for surface irrigation, typically\nperpendicular to the direction of irrigation. They\nprovide water for all surface irrigation systems includ-\ning basin, border, furrow, corrugations, contour ditch,\nand contour levee. The water surface in head ditches\nshould be high enough above the field surface to\nallow design discharge from outlet devices under all\nconditions. Outlets installed too high can cause soil\nerosion, which in turn requires correction.\nOutlet devices may be siphon tubes, notches or cut-\nouts, gated ports or pipes (spiles), or gated structures.\nNotches or cutouts require less head to operate than\nsiphon tubes; however, variation in flow caused by\nwater surface elevation change can be greater. Siphon\ntubes require at least 4 to 6 inches head difference\nbetween the water level in the ditch and field, with 8\nto 10 inches recommended. If possible, head ditches\nshould be nearly level so that water can be checked\nfor maximum distances, thus requiring fewer check\ndams and less labor. Good workable grades are 0.05\nto 0.2 foot per 100 feet.\nField ditches work best and require less maintenance\nwhen constructed in medium to fine textured soils.\nSeepage is typically low, and banks are more stable\nand are easier to build and maintain. Vegetation and\nburrowing animals can cause problems with any soil.\nOpen ditches take up valuable space and can hinder\nfarm operations. Maintenance requirements are much\nhigher than those for pipelines.\nOpen ditches, laterals, and canals can provide good\nhabitat for a variety of wildlife. Keeping ditches clear\nof vegetation requires less overall maintenance, but\nlimits wildlife cover and food. Herbicides are some-\ntimes not friendly to wildlife and their food supply.\nWell vegetated ditchbanks can help prevent soil\nerosion and at the same time be good habitat for\nseveral varieties of upland game birds.\n(a) Unlined ditches\nSeepage is generally not a problem in medium to fine\ntextured soils; however, erosion and downstream\nsediment deposition can occur if soils are erosive. In\ncoarse textured soils, seepage can be a big problem.\nDelivery and field ditches are generally installed and\ncleaned with a V-ditcher mounted on or pulled by a\nfarm tractor. Larger ditches can be constructed and\nmaintained using backhoe type equipment or small\nfront-end loaders.\nWater measuring and control using unlined ditches is\nless convenient and sometimes difficult. Portable\nplastic or canvas dams are generally used to raise the\nwater elevation for diversion onto a field. Typically\nportable plastic or canvas dams have a useful life of 1\nyear.\n(b) Lined ditches\nSeepage, erosion and bank stabilization problems in\nmedium to coarse textured soils can be controlled\nwith ditch linings. The lining material used depends on\nclimate (temperature extremes, freezing and frost\nheave potential), soil conditions, on-farm livestock,\nlocal area wildlife, such as deer, installation cost, and\nmaintenance. Improved water control on the down-\nstream end of head ditches can be reason enough to\ninstall ditch lining material.",

Flexible membranes should be protected from\nphysical damage and ultraviolet light by covering with\naggregate or soil. Flexible membranes with concrete\nor aggregate protection can be installed underwater if\nthe water velocity is less than 5 feet per second.\nThe suitability, limitations, and general installation\nrequirements of lined ditches are described in more\ndetail in NEH, Part 623 (Section 15), Chapter 3, Plan-\nning Irrigation Systems. Design criteria, installation\nrequirements, and material specifications for the most\ncommon linings are detailed in the National Handbook\nof Conservation Practices and other references.\n(c) Seepage losses\nMethods used to determine conveyance efficiency and\nestimate seepage losses from open ditches include:\n• Measuring inflow and outflow in specific reaches\nusing existing or portable measuring devices,\nsuch as weirs, flumes, or current meters.\n• Using controlled ponding and measuring the rate\nof water level drop.\n• Using seepage meters, such as a portable con-\nstant-head permeameter.\n• Estimating losses based on characteristics of the\nbase material.\nControlled ponding is one of the most accurate meth-\nods, but must be done during a non-operation period.\nIt requires installation of small dams to isolate the\nstudy area. Ponding must begin above the normal\nwater surface elevation and continue below the nor-\nmal elevation of operation. At the normal water sur-\nface, the volume of water lost (usually cubic feet) can\nbe converted to a rate per hour (or minute) per square\nfoot of wetted ditch perimeter.\nAccuracy of the inflow-outflow method depends on\naccuracy of flow measuring devices and is generally\nlimited to longer reaches. However, seepage can be\nmeasured during operation periods.\nEstimating seepage losses in the delivery system is\ndescribed in more detail in NEH, Part 623 (Section 15),\nChapter 2, Irrigation Water Requirements. A range of\nexpected seepage losses, depending on the base mate-\nrial in the ditch, lateral or canal, is provided. The range\nis dependent on the amount of fines in the soil.",

These structures are typi-\ncally constructed to help assure proper delivery and\ndistribution of water supply, to prevent erosion, and to\nkeep water losses to a minimum. Adequate water\ncontrol structures also reduce labor. They include\nwater measuring devices, an essential part of efficient\nwater application and use. The type of structures and\nmaterials adaptable are dependent on climate, site\nconditions, water delivery system, irrigation system\nused, and cost of installation and maintenance. Water\ncontrol structures are described in more detail in\nNEH, Part 623 (Section 15), Chapter 3, Planning Farm\nIrrigation Systems; National Engineering Field Hand-\nbook, Chapter 15; and National Handbook of Conser-\nvation Practices, FOTG (Section 4).\n(a) Related structures for open\nditches\nWhere open ditches are used to deliver water to sprin-\nkler, surface, or subirrigation systems, structures are\ntypically needed to screen and remove trash and\ndebris, settle and remove sediment, measure flow,\ndivide water, control grade for erosion protection at\ngated flow turnouts and ports, for spill and overflow,\nditch checks, and pipeline inlets and outlets. Some\ntype of structure may be needed to carry water across\ndepressions or drains and under roadways or other\nobstructions. Flumes, inverted siphons (sag pipes),\nand culverts are the most commonly used structures\nfor these purposes.\n(1) Flumes\nFlumes are channels constructed from metal, wood,\nconcrete, or plastic. They are used to:\n• Control water through a short channel reach; i.e.,\nwater measuring flume ditch check.\n• Transport water across landscape depressions.\n• Transport water across high seepage or unstable\nareas.\nFlumes can be supported directly on earth or by a\nconcrete, metal, or wood substructure. Flume capacity\nis usually determined by the flow capacity of the ditch.\nThe foundation and substructure are designed to\nsupport full flume conditions even though normal flow\nrates are less. Flume channels can be any shape, but\nare typically rectangular, half round, or full diameter\npipe. Hydraulically, all operate as open channels.\nProperly designed welded steel and corrugated metal\npipe can be used to span short distances instead of\nproviding a continuous substructure.\n(2) Siphons\nSiphons are used to carry water over low rises on the\nlandscape or other obstructions. For flow to occur the\nnet hydraulic gradient must be positive, including\nentrance head, pipeline friction, and outlet head\nlosses. Maximum allowable rise is determined by\nlocation of the site above mean sea level. In all practi-\ncality, elevation differences should be no more than 5\nto 10 feet, with both ends of the siphon either covered\nby water or controlled with a valve.\nA vacuum pump can be used to prime the siphon and\nexhaust accumulated air during operation, thus main-\ntaining siphon capacity. Air must be exhausted, but\nnot allowed to enter the conduit. Siphon design water\nvelocities should be 2 to 3 feet per second.\nSlow velocities can be a problem in siphons. Negative\npressures cause dissolved air to release and collect at\nthe high point of the siphon. The increased size of the\nair bubble causes reduction in flow by reducing the\neffective cross section area of the pipe. Ultimately, the\nsiphon may cease operation. High velocities help carry\ndissolved air on through the siphon or at least give less\nresidence time in the negative pressure zone. Multiple\nindividually controlled pipelines that are small in\ndiameter may be desirable rather than one larger\npipeline. Operating as few pipelines in the group as\npossible is suggested where flows are low. This helps\nmaintain higher pipeline velocities.\nAvailable alternatives to using a siphon should be\nseriously considered because construction require-\nments are high and continuous high maintenance is\nrequired. If energy is available, high volume propeller\nor axial flow pumps are generally preferred.",

They can be installed on mul-\ntiple foundations above the ground surface or can be\nburied. Inverted siphons can also be used to cross\nunder roadways, pipelines, and other obstructions. For\nflow to occur the net hydraulic gradient must be\npositive, including entrance head, pipeline friction,\nand outlet head losses. To prevent freezing damage in\ncold climates, drainage of the conduit during winter\nmonths should be considered. Inverted siphons differ\nfrom flumes in that some part of the siphon operates\nunder a pressure head.\n(4) Culverts\nCulverts are conduits installed at or slightly below\nditch grade and are commonly used to carry water\nunder farm roads or field access points. They are\ntypically corrugated metal pipe (CMP), welded steel\npipe, concrete pipe, or plastic pipe. Either full or\npartial pipe flow conditions occur, depending on\ndesign and installation. To increase flow area at shal-\nlow depths, a larger circular pipe installed below grade\nmay be more desirable than a pipe of elliptical (pipe\narch) cross section or multiple pipes on grade. Where\npipeline velocities are greater than 2 feet per second,\nthe full pipe diameter can be considered as the effec-\ntive hydraulic cross section. Where pipeline velocities\nare less than 2 feet per second, or to be more conser-\nvative, assume the below grade portion of the pipe is\nsilted full.\n(5) Grade control structures\nWhere the ditch grade is such that the design flow\nwould result in an erosive velocity, some protective\nstructure, such as a chute spillway, drop spillway, or\npipe drop (or canal lining), is necessary. These struc-\ntures control velocity in the ditch by dropping the\nwater abruptly from a higher elevation to a lower\nelevation in a short protected distance. They can also\nserve as a ditch crossing (if designed as such) or water\nmeasuring device. With grades exceeding 2 to 3 per-\ncent, such alternatives as a pipeline or lined ditch\nshould be considered. In all cases unstable flows\n(including hydraulic jumps) must occur within the\nstructure.\n(6) Distribution structures and devices\nDistribution control structures are necessary for easy\nand accurate division of irrigation water to fields on a\nfarm or to various parts of a field. These structures\nmay consist of:\n• Division boxes to direct flow of water to two or\nmore pipelines or ditches.\n• Check structures that raise the elevation of the\nwater surface upstream so that water can be\ndiverted from the ditch onto a field.\n• Turnout structures to divert part or all the irriga-\ntion stream to a selected part of the irrigated\narea.\nEach water division structure should provide flow\nmeasurement on every outlet. Calibrated flow cross\nsections or standard water measuring weirs and\nflumes can be used. Little cost increase is incurred\nwhere the measuring device is designed and installed\nas a part of the initial structure.\nVarious devices are used for controlling and discharg-\ning water into each furrow, basin, or border. For basin\nand border systems, outlet control devices are gener-\nally either flashboard structures, gated structures,\nshort gated pipe, or large diameter siphon tubes.\nWhere large flows are used, erosion protection at the\nstructure outlet is generally needed. Where water\nvelocities within the structure are appropriate to\nprevent sedimentation, outlets can be installed below\nfield grade. Excess energy is absorbed as water raises\nwith the structure (apron or pipeline).\nFor furrow systems, near equal flow should be deliv-\nered to each furrow. The most commonly used outlets\nare siphon tubes or gated spiles or pipe. To change\nflow, only the slides on gates need to be adjusted or\nthe water level can be raised or lowered at the up-\nstream or downstream end of the siphon tube. Flow\nrate in siphon tubes results from head (elevation)\ndifference in upstream and downstream water levels.\nWhere the outlet end of a siphon tube is above the\nwater surface in the furrow, the pipe centerline eleva-\ntion of the tube outlet becomes the downstream water\nlevel. Two smaller diameter siphon tubes are fre-\nquently used for each furrow. This allows one to be\nremoved to cutback or reduce flow in a furrow where\nthe advance rate is excessive (such as wheel com-\npacted or hard furrows).",

However, the irrigation\nhead or ditch flow must be reduced, the additional\nwater must be bypassed, or additional siphon tubes\nmust be set. When additional tubes are set, a new\nirrigation set start time and end time are established.\nThey then need to be cut back, and the extra water\nreset, and so forth.\n(b) Related structures for gravity\npipelines\nWhere gravity flow pipelines are used to distribute\nwater to surface or subsurface irrigation systems or to\nhelp pressurize sprinkler irrigation systems, structures\nare typically needed for:\n• Trash and debris removal, and perhaps water\nscreening (or filtering)\n• Pipeline inlet and outlet\n• Flow measurement\n• Miscellaneous valves, such as flow control, air\nrelease, vacuum relief, pressure regulation, and\nsurge control\n• Head control for gated pipe, cablegation, and\nsurge systems\n• Drains\n(c) Related structures for pumped\npipelines\nWhere pumped pipelines are used to distribute water\nto surface, sprinkler, micro, and subirrigation systems,\nstructures are typically needed for pumping plant\ninlets (including trash and debris removal), water\nscreening (filtering), flow measurement, drains, surge\nblocks, and valves, such as pressure regulation, air\nrelease, vacuum relief, and flow control.\nStandard drawings for water control structures\nshould be used whenever and wherever possible.\nMaterials used in water control structures include\ncast in place concrete, concrete or cinder block\nmasonry, grouted rock riprap, steel (painted, galva-\nnized, glass coated), aluminum, treated or nontreated\nwood, and plastic. Nonstructural concrete or cinder\nblock masonry structures can be installed without\nmortar if every hole is filled with mortar and a #3 (3/8\ninch) reinforcing bar is used to help maintain vertical\nalignment. Horizontal reinforcement (i.e., K web) with\nmortar, is provided every 16 to 24 inches of height. An\nextended reinforced concrete structure floor provides\nfootings (foundation) for stacked blocks. Number\nthree or larger reinforcing bars extend out of the\nfoundation into the first two or three layers of blocks.\nFor aesthetics, exposed areas can be plastered with\nmortar.\nDurability, installation and maintenance costs, aesthet-\nics and environmental compatibility, ease of use, farm\nlabor skills, and availability of materials are all neces-\nsary considerations for designing these related struc-\ntures. Many standard drawings are available for water\ncontrol structures. See section 652.0710, State supple-\nment, for standard drawings and design procedures.",

As the demand\nfor water and energy increases, the need for more\nefficient use of water increases. Water measurement is\nessential for equitable distribution of the water supply\nand for efficient use on the farm. Knowing how much\nwater is applied is essential for proper irrigation water\nmanagement. Flow measurement has other uses; for\nexample, they can indicate when a pump impeller is\nbecoming worn and inefficient or when well discharge\nbecomes reduced. Flow changes can also indicate\nclogged screens or partly closed or plugged valves.\nWater rights and use requirements increasingly specify\nthat measuring devices be installed.\nThe most common methods of water measurement\nand the equipment or structures are described in\ngreater detail in NEH, Part 623 (section 15), Chapter 9,\nMeasurement of Irrigation Water; the ASAE publica-\ntion Flow Measuring Flumes for Open Channel Sys-\ntems written by Bos, Replogle, Clemmens in 1991; and\nthe U.S. Bureau of Reclamation’s interagency 1997\npublication of the Water Measurement Manual. USDA\nNRCS and Agricultural Research Service provided\ninput to this publication to make it state-of-art in flow\nmeasurement. Publication is late 1997.\nCommon measuring devices are further described\nin chapter 9 of this guide. Units of flow rate and\nflow volume commonly used are cubic feet per second\n(ft3/sec), gallons per minute (gal/min), gallons per hour\n(gal/hr), million gallons per day, acre-inches per day,\nacre-feet per day, miners inches, head of water, acres\nof water, feet of water, shares, acre feet, acre inches,\nand inches of water. Head or depth units commonly\nused are feet, tenths and hundredths of feet; and\ninches and tenths of inches.\nIrrigation consultants must acquaint themselves with\nterms and flow units used locally and must be able to\nconvert to units commonly used in tables, graphs,\ncharts, and computer programs. Many ARS, commer-\ncial, and university computer programs used for de-\nsign of irrigation system components can use either\nEnglish or metric units.\n(a) Planning and design\nconsiderations\nTo accurately measure water, water measurement\ndevices must be installed according to requirements\nspecific to that device. In addition, they must be oper-\nated under the conditions for which they are designed.\nMaintenance must be performed as with any other part\nof an irrigation system. Re-calibration of some devices\nmay be necessary to assure long-term continuing\naccuracy.\nMany types of devices can be used for flow measure-\nment. The best suited device depends on accuracy\ndesired, ease of use, durability, availability, mainte-\nnance required, hydraulic characteristics, ease of\nconstruction, and installation cost. In some areas state\nand local requirements dictate. The following methods\nor devices each have their own flow equation or cali-\nbration process.\n(1) Open ditch flow\nVolumetric—Flow measurements are made by mea-\nsuring time required to fill a known volume.\nSubmerged orifices—Sharp edged orifices of vari-\nous shapes and sizes can be used. Head differential of\nwater surface upstream and downstream causes flow\nthrough the orifice. Flow is calculated using standard\norifice flow equations. The orifice flow “Coefficient”\nfor many types of orifices has been determined experi-\nmentally.\nWeirs—Sharp crested (Cipolletti, 90° V-notch, rectan-\ngular) and broad crested (Replogle). Flow depth\n(head) is measured upstream of crest. Crest width\n(opening width) can be either standard to fit previ-\nously prepared tables or measured, and flow is calcu-\nlated using standard equations. Sharp crested weirs\nmust meet criteria for the specific type (typically 1/8\ninch). Tables are readily available for standard crest\nwidths. Head loss across sharp crested weirs is high,\noften several inches or feet. Where installation and\noperation meet standard, accuracy can be within 5\npercent of actual.\nThe broad crested weir (sometimes called a Replogle\nflume) is the easiest to install of any weir or flume and\ncan accurately measure water with as little as 1 inch of\nhead loss. There is only one critical surface and it is\nlevel in all directions. However, a short section of",

Well designed and constructed shaft gauges\nare typically within 5 percent of actual. Only one flow\nmeasurement depth is required.\nFlumes (Parshall, WSC, cutthroat, or V-notch)—\nHead is measured, crest width is standard or measur-\nable, and flow is calculated using standard equations.\nTables are readily available for standard widths. Mea-\nsurement is fairly accurate at near submerged flow\ncondition; however, measurement of flow depth both\nupstream and downstream of the control section is\nrequired. Accuracy can be within 5 percent of actual.\nBecause of the numerous critical surfaces, these\nflumes can be difficult to construct. Since flow mea-\nsuring accuracy is no better (and often worse) these\nflumes are no longer recommended. The Replogle\nflume should be used.\nCurrent meter—Actual flow velocity at various\npoints and depths (typically .6 or .2 and .8) within the\nflow cross-section is measured. Flow is calculated\nbased on\nQ \tA V\t=\nRepeated measurements are typically taken at each\nmeasuring location. Technique and practice are impor-\ntant to keep accuracy within 10 percent of actual.\nVelocity head rod (jump stick)—Rise in water\nsurface elevation is measured when a standard rod is\nplaced in the water flow path with the narrow side and\nthen the flat side facing upstream. The difference in\nwater surface level represents velocity head. Velocity\n(V) is calculated from:\nV \tg h\t= ( \t)\t2\n1\n2\nFlow is then calculated using Q=AV, wherein A is the\nflow area represented by each velocity and segments\nare accumulated to present the total flow.\nFloat method—Surface flow velocity and flow cross-\nsection are measured, then flow rate is calculated\nusing:\nQ \tC A V\t=\nwhere:\nC = coefficient of discharge calibrated for site\nconditions, typically 0.80 to 0.95\nRated sections—A staff gage is provided to indicate\nflow depths. Velocity at various depths is measured\nusing a current meter. Flow is calculated using Q = AV.\nA depth versus flow rate curve is developed for each\nspecific cross section; thereafter, only flow depth is\nmeasured. Accuracy depends on technique and consis-\ntency of the technician taking readings.\n(2) Pipe flow\nFlow meters (propeller, impeller)—Flow meters\nare volumetrically calibrated at the factory for various\npipe diameters. Accuracy can be within 5 percent of\nactual if meter is well maintained and calibrated\nperiodically. Annual maintenance is required. Debris\nand moss collect quite easily on the point and shaft of\nthe impeller causing malfunction. Therefore, some\ndegree of screening for debris and moss removal may\nbe necessary.\nDifferential head meters—These meters include\npitot tube, shunt flow meters, and low head venturi\nmeters. Pressure differential across an obstruction is\nmeasured, thus providing velocity head. Flow is calcu-\nlated using Q = AV. Coefficients provide for improved\naccuracy.\nOrifice plates—Pressure head upstream and down-\nstream of an orifice of known cross section is mea-\nsured. Flow is calculated using Q = AV. Coefficients\nprovide for improved accuracy.\nUltrasonic meters—These meters measure changes\nin sound transmission across the diameter of the pipe\ncaused by the flowing liquid. They are generally high\ncost and are most often used only in permanent instal-\nlations. Some types work well only with turbid water\n(doppler). Others (transit time) work best in clean\nwater. Portable sonic meters are available, but require\na high degree of technology to operate them satisfacto-\nrily on different pipe diameters and materials. Fre-\nquent calibration can be required.",

Such facili-\nties can be classified according to the method of\nhandling runoff or tailwater. If the water is returned to\na field lying at a higher elevation, it is referred to as a\nreturn-flow or pumpback facility. If the water is ap-\nplied to adjacent or lower-lying field, it is termed\nsequence use. In all cases runoff is temporarily stored\nuntil sufficient volume has accumulated to optimize\napplication efficiency on each succeeding irrigation\nset.\nComponents consist of tailwater ditches to collect the\nrunoff, drainageways, waterways, or pipelines to\nconvey water to a central collection area, a sump or\nreservoir for water storage, a pump and power unit,\nand a pipeline or ditch to convey water for redistribu-\ntion. Under certain conditions where gravity flow can\nbe used, neither a pump nor pipeline is necessary.\n(a) Planning and design consider-\nations\n(1) Storage\nA tailwater collection, storage, and return flow facility\nmust provide for temporary storage of a given amount\nof water. It includes the required pumping equipment\nand pipeline or ditch to deliver water at the appropri-\nate rate to the application system. A sequence system\nshould have storage, a pump, and only enough pipe to\nconvey water to the head ditch of the next adjacent or\ndownslope field. It may be possible to plan the facility\nso there is enough elevation difference between fields\nto apply runoff water to a lower field by gravity with-\nout pumping. Only the lowest field(s) require\npumpback or have tailwater runoff.\nRecovery facilities may also be classified according to\nwhether or not they accumulate and store runoff\nwater. Facilities storing precipitation and irrigation\nrunoff water are referred to as reservoir systems.\nReservoirs can be located either at the lower end of\nthe field or at the upper end. Facilities that return the\nrunoff water for direct irrigation require the least\nstorage capacity. They have automatically cycled\npumping and are termed cycling-sump facilities.\nOne or more types of recovery systems may be appli-\ncable to a given farm. A sump is used where land value\nis high, water cannot be retained in a reservoir, or\nwater ponding is undesirable. Dugouts or reservoirs\nare more common and most easily adapted to storage\nand planned recovery of irrigation tailwater. Hydrauli-\ncally, only tailwater runoff from one irrigation set\nneeds to be stored. Storing water from a maximum of\ntwo irrigation sets improves management flexibility.\nFigure 7–2 displays a typical plan for tailwater recov-\nery facility involving a pumpback system.\nCycling-sump facilities require more intensive water\nmanagement. When cycling begins, the furrow ad-\nvance phase should begin, otherwise additional fur-\nrows must be started. One option is to reduce the\nincoming water supply by the amount equivalent to the\nreturn rate being added.\nReservoir facilities tend to increase irrigation effi-\nciency while decreasing management intensity require-\nment. Reservoir tailwater reuse facilities collect\nFigure 7–2 \tTypical tailwater collection and reuse facility\nfor quick-cycling pump and reservoir\nInlet \tCollector ditch\nRegulating\nreservoir\nWater\nsupply\nHead\nditch\nSump &\npump\nReturn\npipeline",

Thus they have the\nmost flexibility. The reservoir size depends on whether\ncollected water is handled as an independent supply\nand, if not, on the rate water is pumped for reuse.\nTailwater reuse reservoirs should be at least 8 feet\ndeep, preferably 10 feet deep, to discourage growth of\naquatic weeds. For weed control, side slopes of 2 or\n2.5 feet horizontal to 1 foot vertical are recommended.\nSome soils require flatter slopes to maintain stability.\nA centrally located ramp with a slope of five to one\n(5:1) or flatter should be provided for wildlife, either\nas access or for exiting after accidentally falling in.\nThe reservoir should remain nearly full when not in\nuse to help assure a positive hydraulic gradient for\nreservoir sealing. At least 2 feet of water depth should\nremain in the reservoir to provide pump intake sub-\nmergence, protect the reservoir bottom seal, and\nprovide water for wildlife. Tailwater inflow must enter\nthe reservoir at or near the pump intake. Most sus-\npended sediments return to the upper end of the field\ninstead of settling in the reservoir.\n(2) Pumps\nCycling-sump facilities consist of a sump and pump\nlarge enough to handle the expected rate of runoff.\nThe sump is generally a vertical concrete or steel\nconduit with a concrete bottom. The conduit is about 6\nto 10 feet deep when placed on end. Pump operation is\ncontrolled automatically by a float-operated or elec-\ntrode-actuated switch. Some storage can be provided\nin the collecting ditch or pipeline upstream of the\nsump.\nThe size, capacity, location, and selection of equip-\nment for these facilities are functions of the selected\nirrigation system, topography, layout of the field and\nthe water users irrigation management and desires.\nMany different low head pumps are used with tailwa-\nter reuse facilities. Pumps include single stage turbine,\nhorizontal centrifugal (permanent or tractor driven),\nsubmerged vertical centrifugal, and propeller or axial\nflow pumps. Pumping heads are generally low, conse-\nquently energy requirements are low (5 to 10 hp), even\nfor reasonably high flow rates. Tractor driven pumps\nare typically overpowered.\nCaution should be used when selecting pump and\npower unit size. For example, in a cycling-sump facil-\nity the lowest continuous pumping rate that will main-\ntain the design flow rate should be used. For reservoir\ntype facilities where water is delivered from a tailwa-\nter sump directly to the head ditch, it is better to pump\nat a high rate for the first part of an irrigation set (to\ndecrease irrigation advance time). Pumping efficien-\ncies can be in the range of 20 to 75 percent, depending\nupon the type and size of pump selected, the power\nunit used, and pump inlet and outlet conditions. Some\ndegree of screening at the pump inlet is generally\nrequired. In all cases, irrigation water management\nshould optimize use of water, labor, and energy.\n(3) Sizing for runoff\nRunoff (RO) flows must be measured or estimated to\nproperly size tailwater reuse sumps, reservoirs, and\npumping facilities. Table 7–1 displays expected recov-\nery in gallons per minute based on irrigation head or\ninflow and expected runoff. Expected recovery and\nreturn to the head of the irrigation system is based on\n65 percent of the runoff. Seepage, evaporation, over-\nflow, and miscellaneous losses occur in a recovery,\nstorage, and pumpback system. An irrigation system\nevaluation should be used to determine runoff. An\nexample of a tailwater recovery and pumpback facility\nfollows:\nFurrow flow analysis gives runoff \tRO = 35%\nIrrigation head (inflow) \tQi \t= 1,000 gpm\nExpected recovery at peak runoff \tQr \t= 228 gpm\nUse this recovery flow to size transport and storage\nfacilities. In addition, capacity should be provided to\nhandle concurrent peak runoff events from both\nprecipitation and tailwater, unexpected interruption of\npower, and other uncertainties. Where a reservoir,\nrecovery pit, or dugout is used, it should have the\ncapacity to store the runoff from one complete irriga-\ntion set. Pump capacity will be dependent on the\nmethod or schedule of reuse planned. Table 7–2 pro-\nvides data for sizing tailwater reservoirs and sumps\nbased on desired pump peak flow and desired set time.\nOverall irrigation efficiencies obtainable by using\ntailwater recovery facilities are listed in table 7–3.\nWhere irrigation tailwater cannot enter at or near the\npump, a small collection basin installed at the inlet to\nthe storage reservoir is more desirable than allowing\nsediment to collect in the reservoir. The basin can be",

Automation is the use of mechanical\ngates, valves, structures, controllers, and other devices\nto automatically divert water into an operating irriga-\ntion system to satisfy the water requirement of a\ngrowing crop.\nResearch and development by ARS, state experiment\nStations, and industry have produced successful\nstructures, controls, computer software, and other\ndevices to automatically control irrigation water.\nHowever, automated irrigation (with the exception of\nmicro and solid set sprinkler) use is limited. New\ntechnology, including automation, is adopted only\nwhen the irrigation water user views the real (or\nperceived) risk as being equal to or less than the\ncurrent procedure being used. Commercially produced\nsystems and components are currently available.\nThe increasing cost of power for pumping and irriga-\ntion labor is increasing water users’ interest in ways of\nreducing costs. Automation of surface and sprinkler\nsystems is one consideration. Many irrigators who\nconsider switching from surface irrigation to sprinkler\nirrigation have continued with surface methods to\nreduce or eliminate pumping costs. All irrigation\nsystems that apply water by surface, sprinkler, subsur-\nface, and micro irrigation methods can presently be\nautomated to some degree. A high potential exists to\nincrease irrigation efficiencies through improved\nirrigation water management using existing irrigation\nsystems. Reduced labor and increased production are\nadded benefits.\n(a) Planning and design consider-\nations for automation\nAutomated irrigation systems and their associated\ncomponents are classified as either automatic or\nsemiautomatic.\n(1) Automatic systems\nFully automated irrigation systems normally operate\nwithout operator attention except for calibration,\nperiodic inspections, and routine maintenance. The\nirrigator determines when or how long to irrigate and\nthen turns water into the system and starts pro-\ngrammed controllers to initiate the automated func-\ntions.\nFully automated systems typically use either soil\nmoisture sensors or computer processed climatic data\nto activate electric or pneumatic controlled switches\nand valves. Soil moisture sensors send a signal to a\ncentral controller when soil water has been depleted\nto predetermined levels. Daily climatic data can also\nbe used to signal a controller to apply irrigations.\nNRCS SCHEDULER is a field proven irrigation sched-\nuling software usable nationwide. It can be used with\nfully automatic, semiautomatic, and manually oper-\nated surface, sprinkle, micro, and subsurface irrigation\nsystems.\nOnce irrigation has been started, water is diverted into\nthe farm distribution system and irrigation is com-\npleted without operator intervention. Irrigation dura-\ntion can be controlled by programmed timers, soil\nmoisture sensors, or surface water sensors. Fully\nautomated systems require a water supply available\nessentially on demand, such as from irrigation district\ncanals, private wells or reservoirs.\n(2) Semiautomatic systems\nSemiautomatic systems and controls require attention\nduring each irrigation and are usually simpler and less\ncostly than automatic systems. Most semiautomated\nsystems use mechanical or electronic timers to acti-\nvate control structures at predetermined times. The\nirrigator generally determines the beginning time and\nduration, then manually resets or returns the devices\nto their original position. Some devices can be moved\nfrom one location to another before the next irriga-\ntion. Parts of a given system may be automatic, while\nother parts are semiautomatic or manually operated.\nOften automation of one irrigation set change (during\nthe night or offsite working hours) has nearly the same\nbenefits as a fully automated system and at consider-\nably less cost and risk.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nFarm Distribution Components\tChapter 7\n7–16 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\n(3) Communications\nMost automated and some semiautomated system\ncomponents can be remotely controlled by centrally\nlocated controllers. Such systems require communica-\ntion between the controller and system components\nlocated in the field. Communication may be by direct\ninterconnecting electrical wires, hydraulic or pneu-\nmatic conduits, radio or infrared telemetry, or a com-\nbination of these. Spurious signals and interference is\nsometimes a problem when telemetry is used.\n(4) Surface irrigation system automation\nTechnology is available to automate most surface\nirrigation systems; however, automation use is limited.\nNew technology adoption by a user must have a real or\nperceived risk equal to or less than the method or\nsystem currently in use. If an irrigator cannot sleep\nuntil he or she personally checks to see if a valve or\ngate changed during the night, automation is of no\nbenefit.\nLevel basin and level furrow surface irrigation systems\nare perhaps the easiest to automate. Where irrigation\ninflows are known application volume can be con-\ntrolled by time. With graded furrow and graded border\nsurface irrigation systems, succeeding irrigation set\nchanges can be initiated by the presence of free water\non the soil surface at a predetermined location down\nthe field.\nDrop-open or drop-close gates in a short flume or lined\nditch can be used to control water surface elevation\nand location in open ditches. Gravity plus the pressure\nof water in the ditch operates each gate. Typically,\nirrigation water discharge from a supply ditch onto a\nfield is controlled by water surface elevation in the\nditch and the number of openings onto the field.\nDitches must be installed on a predetermined grade\nand elevation so that water will be applied uniformly\nto borders or to the correct number of furrows at a\nproper design rate. Set time is provided to allow a full\nor planned irrigation to occur.\nSimple electronic or windup timers can control gate\noperation. A 12 volt battery (or 120 volt AC) with a\nsolenoid can move a slide bolt initiating gate move-\nment. Some batteries are kept charged by solar panels.\nBoth drop-open and drop-close gates are actuated and\nsealed by the energy from water moving in the supply\nditch. With drop-open gates irrigation progresses\ndownstream. Drop-close gates require that irrigation\nproceed upstream. A 12 volt battery (or 120 volt AC)\ncan be used (either directly or to power a pump) for\nelectric, hydraulic, and pneumatic opening and closing\nmotors and cylinders. Each irrigation head can be\nsemiautomatic with two gate opening (closing) assem-\nblies. While the second assembly is operating, the first\nor previous assembly is moved ahead and adjusted for\nthe next irrigation set.\nGates, ports, spiles, notches, or longitudinal overflow\nweirs can direct water onto a field. Adequate erosion\ncontrol is always a consideration.\nGated pipe systems, including surge and cablegation,\ncan be automated using electric or wind-up timer\ncontrolled valves to initiate the irrigation cycle. There\nafter, the surge or cablegation controller operates the\nirrigation set. Some field cross slope or fall in the\ngated pipeline is necessary. ARS Publication 21,\nCablegation Systems for Irrigation: Description, De-\nsign, Installation and Performance (ARS 1985), should\nbe referenced for cablegation design. NRCS publica-\ntion Surge Flow Irrigation Field Guide (USDA 1986),\nshould be referenced for surge design.\n(5) Sprinkler and micro irrigation systems\nSeveral methods of automating sprinkler and micro\nirrigation systems are available. Center pivot manufac-\nturers presently have fully automatic devices including\nmonitoring of climate for determining crop ET, soil\nmoisture monitoring, and system on-off controllers, all\ncontrolled with an onboard computer. Automatic\nsystems are available with fully automatic controllers\nincluding moisture sensors or time clock operation for\nsolid set sprinkler, micro, and greenhouse irrigation\nsystems.\nPeriodic move irrigation systems, such as side roll and\nhandmove systems, generally are not automated.\nHowever, a simple form of automation is timer con-\ntrolled lateral shutdown and turn-on. With two laterals\nthe dry lateral can be moved at a time more conve-\nnient to the irrigator. This allows the irrigator to have\nsome flexibility when water is changed. Although not\nnecessary, this method works best when water is\navailable on demand.",

Designing an efficient, cost effective pump\nrequires close attention to detail and a knowledge of\nbasic hydraulic principles of pump design. The de-\nsigner must consider the pump, delivery system, and\nirrigation system as a whole. An annual economic\nanalysis may be needed to determine the least costly\nalternative. See chapter 11 of this guide for economic\nanalysis procedures.\nEvery commercially manufactured pump has a known\nand published relationship between head (pressure)\nand volume (capacity) produced. This relationship is\ngenerally plotted as a curve called the pump character-\nistic curve, pump performance curve, or pump head-\ncapacity curve. Multiple curves are used to show\ncharacteristics of different impeller diameters and\nimpeller rotation speeds used in the same size and\nmodel pump. Pump characteristic curves are available\nfrom pump dealers and manufacturers free of charge\nto designers and pump owners. Every pumping plant\nevaluation should include a review of the pump char-\nacteristic curves for the pumps being used. Pump\nspecific characteristic curves are essential for design-\ning or evaluating pumps operating in series or parallel.\nVariables contributing to the head-capacity relation-\nship include:\n• Pump make, model number, and discharge size\n• Impeller type, diameter, and speed of rotation\n• Number of impellers (or pumps) operating in\nseries\n• Net input energy required (usually expressed in\nbrake horsepower)\n• Net positive suction head (in feet)\n• Impeller efficiency\nNet Positive Suction Head (NPSH) is the elevation\nwater can be raised at sea level by the suction side of a\nspecific pump impeller. Unless the pump is self prim-\ning, the pump impeller must first be filled with water.\nIf the allowable NPSH for a specific pump is exceeded,\nthe pump will lose prime.\nEvery pump installation has an optimum operating\nefficiency. The designer should strive to select pump\noperation at or near that efficiency. It is very unlikely\nthat a used (or even new) pump at a bargain price can\nbe obtained that fully meets the system needs without\nfirst checking the specific Head-Capacity Curve for\nthat specific make, model, and size of pump. Horse-\npower alone is an inadequate specification for\nselecting a pump. Flow capacity (Q) and Total Dy-\nnamic Head (TDH) are required for pump selection. At\nhigh elevations an adjustment factor for elevation may\nbe needed. Manufacturers use different factors to\nconvert brake horsepower to recommended motor or\nengine horsepower of the drive unit.\nDetailed examples of pump design are in NEH, Part\n623 (Section 15), Chapter 8, Irrigation Pumping Plants,\nand NEH, Part 624 (Section 16), Chapter 7, Drainage\nPumping. In addition, pump manufacturers’ catalogs\nand computer programs have information and design\nassistance on pump design and pump head-capacity\ncharacteristics. Chapter 15 of this guide gives informa-\ntion on interpreting pump characteristic curves, and\nchapter 11 has information about cost analysis for\nirrigation systems.",

Soil used for growing\nturf, landscaping, and agricultural crops must have\nfree drainage. In some cases soils are naturally well\ndrained; however, many soils need installed surface\nand subsurface drainage systems to provide proper\nsoil moisture management flexibility. The greater the\nmanagement flexibility, the greater the potential for\nproper water and nutrient management. Thus, to\nimprove water quality, management flexibility must\nimprove. Where water tables are in or near the plant\nroot zone, water table control is an essential compo-\nnent of irrigation water management.\nCapacity of drainage improvements must be based on\nan analysis of the area irrigated, the anticipated irriga-\ntion application efficiency, and the proportion of\nrunoff and deep percolation anticipated as runoff.\nSubsurface drainage installation on irrigated land is\nnot a substitute for proper irrigation water manage-\nment. However, adequate drainage of the crop root\nzone is essential for long-term production. Only when\ngood irrigation water management is practiced should\nsubsurface drainage installation be considered as an\nadditional water management practice. Also, subsur-\nface drainage is a part of, not a substitute for, proper\nsalinity, sodicity, nutrient, and pesticide management.\nIrrigation with saline or sodic water can inhibit crop\ngrowth and degrade the soil resource. See chapters 2\nand 13 of this guide for information on irrigation water\nand soil salinity or sodicity. Good water management\nalong with properly designed and managed subsurface\ndrainage systems can help maintain a level of salinity\nor sodicity in the plant root zone that allows sustained\nagricultural production.\nProvisions to remove excess precipitation and soil\nseepage water promptly and safely from irrigated land\nmust be maintained as part of farm irrigation water\nmanagement. Without proper water removal, soil,\nwater, plant and animal resources can be degraded. In\nsome cases discontinuation of improperly managed\nirrigation may be the only possible alternative.\nProperly installed subsurface drainage systems can be\nused successfully in water short areas as a supplemen-\ntal source of irrigation water, if it is of reasonably\ngood quality. The water may be used on the field that\nwas drained or on other crops in a different field.\nIncreasing the plant root zone (available soil-water\nstorage) is a recommended water conservation prac-\ntice. In high saline or sodic areas, subsurface drainage\nwater may be used on salt-tolerant crops that are\nspecifically grown to dispose of drainage water. Spe-\ncial disposal methods, such as use of the effluent for\nirrigation of agroforestry plots, for constructed wet-\nlands, or in evaporation ponds, may be necessary for\npoor quality water that cannot be disposed of in public\nwater bodies. Caution must be exercised, however, to\nknow if toxic elements are in the drainage effluent\nand, if so, the concentration. Because ponded water\nattracts waterfowl, any negative impacts on wildlife\nneed to be known and avoided.\nIn high water table soils, subsurface drainage im-\nproves soil condition and the potential plant root zone\ndepth for most crops. This increased soil volume\nincreases plant-water availability when precipitation is\nless than adequate, and improves plant nutrient avail-\nability. Improved soil condition increases soil micro-\norganism activity, thus less fertilizer is generally\nneeded, plus the potential for leaching of nutrients\nbelow the plant root zone is decreased.\nLaws, regulations, and public perception may increas-\ningly limit new subsurface drainage developments and\nmethods used to dispose of drainage water. Most\ndrainage issues will involve maintaining or rehabilitat-\ning existing drainage systems. The irrigation/drainage\nplanning technician must be thoroughly familiar with\nlocal laws and regulations governing drainage.\n(a) Precipitation runoff\nHigh volume storm water runoff should be safely\nstored, diverted around, or carried through the irriga-\ntion system to protect the land, irrigation system, and\ncrop. This may require special erosion control mea-\nsures or modifications in the design or layout of an\nirrigation system.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nFarm Distribution Components\tChapter 7\n7–19\t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nStandard NRCS procedures, as illustrated in the\nEngineering Field Handbook, are available to deter-\nmine the volume and rate of runoff from precipitation.\nRunoff from precipitation can leave the land through\nnatural watercourses or constructed ditches and\nchannels. Tailwater or wastewater ditches are gener-\nally needed at the lower end of irrigation runs to\ncollect runoff from rainfall and irrigation. Storm\nrunoff peaks generally govern capacity requirements.\nWhere storage and tailwater recovery facilities are\nprovided for irrigation, storm runoff containing a\nlarge sediment volume should bypass or be trapped\nbefore entering the storage reservoir to prevent rapid\nloss of storage capacity.\n(b) Irrigation runoff (tailwater)\nSurface irrigation systems cannot place 100 percent of\napplied water in the plant root zone. However, level\nbasin, border, and furrow surface irrigation systems\noperated with good water management including\nplanned deficit irrigation in all or part of the field can\napproach 100 percent water use. Using tailwater reuse\non surface irrigation systems along with good water\nmanagement practices can be efficient. Planned irriga-\ntion deficit in all or part of the field, surge, cutback,\nblocked ends and tailwater reuse are techniques or\nmodifications that, when properly used, can improve\nirrigation uniformity while reducing field or farm\nrunoff.\nTo make a near uniform application of water with a\ngraded surface irrigation system without using some\nof the above techniques or modifications, some irriga-\ntion runoff must result, typically 30 to 50 percent.\nOften runoff water is reduced or eliminated by reduc-\ning inflow streams or blocking the ends of furrows and\nborders. This practice without an appropriate change\nin water management and system layout often trades\nrunoff water for deep percolation (nonuniformity),\nwhich cannot be seen.\nTheoretically, sprinkle irrigation systems should not\nhave runoff. In reality, even with proper water and soil\nmanagement, local translocation, and perhaps some\nfield runoff can occur because of the variable conditions\nincluding soils, topography, and crop interference. If\nfield runoff is anticipated, runoff facilities and manage-\nment must be a part of every irrigation system plan.\nTailwater from irrigation must be recovered and reused,\nor it must be disposed of without damage to down-\nstream lands and water supplies.\n(c) Subsurface drainage\nExcess percolation of precipitation and irrigation\nwater and nearly impermeable soil layers can cause\nhigh water tables. High water tables can restrict crop\nroot development and promote saline or sodic soil\nconditions. Seepage from upslope areas, canals, reser-\nvoirs, and sumps may also waterlog adjacent\ndownslope lands. Excess water that enters the soil\nprofile often percolates below the crop root zone.\nUnless the underlying material is sufficiently perme-\nable to allow continued flow, a water table can form\nand encroach into the potential plant root zone. The\nwater table must be held below the crop root zone to\nprovide aerobic soil conditions for plant root develop-\nment and function.\nSubsurface drains are normally designed to control the\nwater table at least 4 feet below the ground surface.\nSignificant quantities of water can be provided from a\nwater table for plant use. Desirable depth to water\ntable is somewhat dependent on soil type. See infor-\nmation on upflux rate in Chapter 6, Subirrigation.\nSubsurface drainage systems may consist of intercep-\ntor drains, relief drains, or pumped drains. Subsurface\ndrains may also be needed to reduce or eliminate toxic\nmaterials from moving to deeper aquifers that contain\nhigh quality water.\nDesign of subsurface drains should be according to\nprocedures for arid land as described in NEH, Part 624\n(Section 16), Drainage of Agricultural Lands, chapters\n4 and 5. Chapter 7 of this guide provides information\non pumped drainage.\n(1) Interceptor drains\nInterceptor drains are used in sloping areas that have a\nhigh water table gradient. They are generally oriented\nperpendicular to the direction of ground water flow.\nSubsurface drains are commonly used because the\ndrain must be located according to soil and ground\nwater conditions, which may not correspond to field\nboundaries, fences, or property lines.",

These drains\ngenerally are planned as a series of parallel drain\nconduits in a grid or herringbone pattern in which\neach lateral is connected to a submain or main that\nleads to an open channel or sump pump.\n(3) Pumped drains\nPumped drains are used when soils are underlain by\nporous sand or gravel with aquifers that can be low-\nered by pumping or where insufficient fall exists for a\ngravity outlet. Detailed subsurface and ground water\nstudies are required to determine the feasibility of\nlowering the water table by pumping, on a large\nenough area to be economical.\nPumped drains are also used where a layering of the\ngroundwater table is for a short period of time, i.e.,\nduring harvest for improved soil trafficability, in the\nearly part of the growing season for plant establish-\nment, and following periods of excess precipitation.\n(d) Environmental factors\nDrainage planning requires careful consideration of\nenvironmental factors including wetlands, wildlife\nhabitat, and water quality. An environmental assess-\nment of impacts on soil, water, air, plant, and animal\nresources is important when dealing with drainage.\nDrainage related environmental issues and laws are\ncomplex and subject to varying interpretation, which\ncomplicates planning. It frequently takes considerable\neffort to resolve or to even determine the status of\nthese issues.\n(1) Wetlands\nA wetland classification determination is necessary\nwhere wetland conditions are suspected or evident.\nWetlands created by irrigation water seepage or runoff\nmust be considered under current laws. It may be\nnecessary to mitigate irrigation caused wetlands if\nsystem improvements in adjacent areas dry up irriga-\ntion induced wetlands.\nSurface and subsurface drainage can have beneficial\nwetland effects. Discharges of drainage water can be\nused to create or enhance wetland areas. Quality of\ndrainage discharges is an important consideration for\nthe creation or enhancement of wetlands used by\nwildlife.\n(2) Water quality\nNational and State laws require that drains discharging\ninto State watercourses meet certain water quality\nstandards. Currently irrigation runoff is classified as a\nnonpoint source. As such, discharge permits are not\nrequired. However, if a downstream water user files a\ncomplaint, water quality restrictions may be placed on\ndischarges from irrigated land. Permits are required\nfor discharges from point sources, such as feedlots,\nand can be required for subsurface drain outlets.",

Care must be taken to prevent backflow of\nchemically laden water into any water source.\nBackflow prevention devices are required where\nchemicals are injected into any pressurized irrigation\nsystem. Distribution of water on the field must be\nuniform, carefully managed, and controlled. This\nrequires the proper equipment and careful attention to\ndetail. Water quality laws are strict concerning han-\ndling of chemicals applied through irrigation systems.\nOnly chemicals labeled for chemigation (usually\nsprinkler system) application should be used.\n(a) Advantages\nThe advantages of using chemigation include:\n• Cost of chemigation versus aerial or ground\napplication can be less.\n• A chemical can be applied when it is needed\nwithout waiting for the proper weather condi-\ntions the supplier or labor availability. The proce-\ndure can reduce total labor.\n• Application can be more uniform than by other\nmethods under certain conditions.\n• With soil incorporated herbicides, the appropri-\nate amount of water can be applied to incorpo-\nrate the herbicide to the depth desired and to\nactivate it immediately.\n• Soil compaction is reduced because it is not\nnecessary to pass field equipment over the field\nto apply chemicals.\n• Mechanical damage to crops is less than with\nmechanical surface application methods.\n• The hazards to operators are fewer.\n• Less fertilizer may be required, particularly under\nmicro irrigation.\n• Losses from wind drift can be reduced or elimi-\nnated depending on the method of irrigation.\nThis can reduce one cause of chemical loss and\npollution.\n• Chemigation techniques are compatible with no-\ntill soil management systems.\n(b) Disadvantages\nThe disadvantages of using chemigation are:\n• Some chemicals are corrosive to irrigation equip-\nment, especially immediately downstream of the\ninjection point. In most cases the chemicals are\ndiluted further downstream to the point that\ncorrosion is not a serious problem. Injection\nequipment must be designed to handle concen-\ntrated chemicals.\n• Combining chemicals can be dangerous and\nexpensive if not done with full knowledge of the\npotential, sometimes violent, reactions. Chemi-\ncals can also produce precipitates, which can\nclog equipment, or produce toxic vapors.\n• Losses because of volatilization can occur,\nparticularly under sprinkler irrigation.\n• Chemicals that can be used successfully under\nchemigation are limited. Many chemicals are\neither not registered for chemigation application\nor are specifically prohibited from being used.\n• Excess water application or rainfall during\nchemigation can cause the loss of chemicals or\nmake them ineffective through deep percolation\nor runoff. Lost chemicals can contribute to water\npollution.\n• Special injection equipment and irrigation system\nsafety equipment are required. This adds to the\nexpense of the operation.",

The technique is\nrelatively new.\n• A high degree of management and irrigation\nuniformity are required.\n(c) Planning and design\nconsiderations\nThe following information is intended to give NRCS\npersonnel a general understanding of chemigation on\npressure type systems. Detailed design of such sys-\ntems must be done by a qualified engineering firm or\nby those involved in the sale and servicing of equip-\nment.\n(1) Chemical injection equipment\nChemical compounds to be applied through injection\nequipment must be in one of the following forms:\n• Miscible or emulsible liquid\n• Soluble, dry powder (crystal)\n• Insoluble, wettable, dispersible powder.\nSome equipment is manufactured for specific material\n(i.e., type of chemical, chemical concentration, viscos-\nity), so the appropriate types of chemicals and equip-\nment should be chosen. The equipment must have\nadequate capacity. The common methods of injecting\nchemicals are illustrated in figures 7–3 to 7–8. Pumps\ncan be powered by electric drives, engine drives, or\nwater motors. Equipment can be categorized by the\nway the inflow rate of the chemical is controlled. The\nfour categories are gravity flow, educator, metering\npump, and proportioner system.\n(i) \tGravity flow from chemical storage tanks\n(fig. 7–3)—This is the crudest category of chemical\ninjection. Control of injection rate is accomplished by\nadjusting a valve that approximately regulates chemi-\ncal flow into the irrigation water. Chemical flow is\neither into the suction end of a pump or into an open\ngravity flow system. This type injection is generally\nused in surface systems, particularly to add soil addi-\ntives, such as sulfur compounds. It requires careful\noperator attention.\n(ii) Educator—This is the simplest way of introduc-\ning chemicals into the system. Methods used for this\ncategory are:\n• Injection on suction side of pump (fig. 7–4)\n• Venturi principle injection (fig. 7–5)\n• Pitot tube injection (fig. 7–6)\nThe chemical injection rate is approximately propor-\ntional to water flow. The method requires some oper-\nating attention. It can handle liquids and water soluble\nor dry material. The educator equipment should be\nused where water flow is nearly constant.",

However, any time mechani-\ncal devices are being used there is always the possibil-\nity of failure, malfunction, or accidents. Successful and\nsafe chemigation requires safety devices be installed\non the chemigation system. These devices are de-\nsigned to eliminate three possible pollution problems:\n• Backflow of undiluted chemicals to the nurse\ntanks or water source\n• Spill of chemicals on the surface\n• Backflow of water mixed with chemicals from\nthe irrigation system.\nAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineering Stan-\ndard ASAE EP409 covers safety standards for chemi-\ngation equipment and operation. Bulletins, such as No.\n1717, Safety and Calibration Requirements for Chemi-\ngation, from Oklahoma State University, Cooperative\nExtension Service, are readily available through most\nCooperative Extension Service offices.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency provides strin-\ngent requirements for safety equipment and proce-\ndures when applying certain agricultural chemicals\nthrough pressurized irrigation systems. Chemicals\napproved for chemigation have specific verbatim\nstatements on the label. They include:\n• The system must contain a functional check\nvalve, vacuum relief valve, and low pressure\ndrain appropriately located on the irrigation\npipeline to prevent water source contamination.\n• The pesticide injection pipeline must contain a\nfunctional, automatic, quick-closing check valve\nto prevent flow of fluid back toward the injection\npump.\n• The pesticide injection pipeline must also con-\ntain a functional, normally closed, solenoid-\noperated valve located on the intake side of the\ninjection pump and connected to the system\ninterlock to prevent fluid from being withdrawn\nfrom the supply tank when the irrigation system\nis either automatically or manually shut down.\n• The system must contain functional interlocking\ncontrols to automatically shut off the pesticide\ninjection pump when the water pump motor/\nengine stops.\n(iii) \tMetering pump (fig. 7–7)—This method\naccurately meters the chemical into the irrigation\nwater at a predetermined rate. The chemical inflow\nrate is constant with respect to time and allows the\noperator to make changes in the application rate. It\nshould be used where the rate of water flow is nearly\nconstant. The method of injection used is the injection\npump. It can only inject liquids.\n(iv) \tProportioner system—This method of injec-\ntion accurately proportions chemicals to irrigation\nwater flow. It consists of a sensor that determines the\nwater flow rate, a chemical flow control module, and\nan injector pump that injects the chemical. This cat-\negory of injection equipment should be used where the\nirrigation flow rate varies. It is automatic and requires\nlittle operator attention.\nFigure 7–7 \tPressure metering pump injection\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\nBackflow prevention valve\nBackflow prevention valve\nMotor driven\ninjector pump\nSupply tank\nScreen\nTo\nsprinklers\nControl\nvalve",

The valve\nprovides a positive shutoff on the chemical injection\nline.

The three categories of\nfertilizers used are clear liquid, dry, and suspension\nliquid.\nClear liquid fertilizers—These materials are flowable\nproducts containing nutrients in solution. This makes\nthem convenient to handle with pump injectors, ven-\nturi-tubes, and gravity flow from gravity storage tanks.\nLiquid fertilizers contain a single nutrient or combina-\ntions of nitrogen (N), phosphate (P), and potash (K).\nThe most common liquid fertilizers used are listed in\ntable 7–4.\nDry fertilizers—A wide variety of soluble dry fertiliz-\ners is used for injection into irrigation systems. The\ndry fertilizer may be dissolved by mixing with water\nin a separate open tank and then injected into the\nirrigation stream, or they can be placed in a pressur-\nized container through which is bypassed a portion of\nthe sprinkler stream. In the later case the bypassed\nstream continuously dissolves the solid fertilizer until\nit has been applied. Typical dry fertilizers are shown\nin table 7–5.\nSuspension liquid fertilizers—Suspension liquid\nfertilizers produce higher analysis grades than clear\ngrades given the same ratio of N, P, and K. Table 7–6\nshows a comparison of typical analysis of clear and\nsuspension liquid fertilizers. The suspension mixtures\ncontain 110 to 133 percent more plant nutrients than\ncorresponding clear liquids. Because of their higher\nnutrient content, suspensions generally are manufac-\ntured, handled, and applied at less cost than clear\nliquids. Another advantage is that they can hold large\nquantities of micronutrients.\nTable 7–4 \tLiquid fertilizers (solutions) for sprinkler application 1/\nSolution product \tTotal \tAvail \tWater \tTotal \tApproximate pounds of product\nnitro \tphos \tsoluble \tsulfur \tfor 1 pound of nutrient\nacid \tpotash\n% N \t% P \t% K \t% S \tN \tP \tK \tS\nAmmonium nitrate \t20 \t5\nAmmonium phosphate \t8 \t24 \t12 \t4\nPotassium ammonium phosphate \t15 \t15 \t10 \t7 \t7 \t10\n(N-P-K liquid mixes) \t10 \t10 \t10 \t10 \t10 \t10\n15 \t8 \t4 \t7 \t12.5 \t25\nUrea (low biuret) \t23 \t4.4\nUrea - ammonium nitrate \t32 \t3.1\nPhosphoric acid \t52 – 54 \t1.8 – 1.9\nCalcium ammonium nitrate \t17 \t6\n1/ Source: National Fertilizer Development Center, Tennessee Valley Authority, Muscle Shoals, Alabama, 1965.",

Where water for multiple farms is supplied by\nan offsite group, a water distribution system and\nschedule for the irrigated area must be developed. It is\ndesirable to have an adequate source of water avail-\nable and supplied to each irrigated parcel in a timely\nmanner for the crops selected. Various methods have\nbeen employed to accomplish this distribution. Crop\nirrigation water requirements and water supply are\nprimary considerations.\nExperience in planning, design, operation, and man-\nagement of existing projects is desirable. When formu-\nlating a project, a thorough multidisciplinary evalua-\ntion is needed to obtain the most technically appropri-\nate, economical, and environmentally sound solution.\nThe project must be manageable and reasonable to\noperate and maintain. It must also be socially accept-\nable and meet today’s standards.\nThis chapter provides concepts that illustrate the use\nof irrigation water requirement principles when plan-\nning and designing irrigation projects. This is not a\ndesign guide for irrigation delivery systems. Refer to\nother appropriate guidelines for more information on\nproject design. The Natural Resources Conservation\nService (NRCS) reference Economic and Environ-\nmental Principles and Guidelines for Water Related\nLand Resource Implementation Studies provides\ndetailed guidelines for documentation. Section\n652.0808 describes in detail a planning outline that will\nassist planning staffs with irrigation project planning.\nThe intensity of investigations required varies with the\nlevel of planning, scope, and significance of the\nproject. Generally, preliminary planning is less inten-\nsive than planning for investigation and evaluation of\nthe selected alternative. Many computer programs are\navailable to perform various parts of project evalua-\ntion. Their use is encouraged.\nAn irrigation project is defined as blocks of irrigated\nland within a defined boundary, developed or adminis-\ntered by a group or agency. Water is delivered from a\nsource to individual turnouts via a system of canals,\nlaterals, or pipelines. The irrigated block generally\ninvolves many farms that can have multiple fields per\nfarm. Irrigation water requirements used for designing,\nmanaging, or upgrading irrigation projects are similar\nto an on-farm analysis. With projects, the analysis is\nexpanded to include all landowners, cropland area,\ncrops, and irrigation systems. General examples are\nprovided to illustrate the procedure. Irrigation projects\nshould distribute the available water supply to irriga-\ntors in an equitable and dependable manner. The\nirrigator should be aware of flow rates and frequencies\nof available water in their own terms.

Irrigation systems should\nsupply enough water over prolonged periods to satisfy\nthe difference between crop evapotranspiration (ET)\ndemand, rainfall, and ground water contribution. The\nmost conservative method of designing system capac-\nity requirements is to provide enough capacity to meet\nmaximum expected or peak crop ET rates. With\nprojects, this is generally done on a monthly basis. For\nhigh value crops, meeting weekly peak crop ET may be\nnecessary where a very high level of water manage-\nment can be provided.\nA frequency distribution analysis of mean daily crop\nET (daily crop ET vs. frequency, by some time period)\ncan display risks involved in providing something less\nthan meeting peak crop ET 100 percent of the time.\nUsing an example crop in California:\nSupplying water for a 95 percent probability\n(19 of 20 years) requires system capacity to\nmeet a mean daily crop ET = .23 inches per day.\nBy reducing system capacity to meet a mean\ndaily crop ET = .20 inches per day, an 85 percent\nprobability (17 of 20 years) can be met. The\nreduction in system capacity may be economi-\ncally justified.\nIn areas where rainfall provides a substantial portion\nof crop water needs, a frequency analysis of precipita-\ntion should be performed.

The evaluation is usually done monthly\nto provide a basis for monthly storage or diversion and\ndelivery needs.

If the on-farm typical weighted\nirrigation water requirement represents the entire\nproject area, then all laterals and canals are sized\naccordingly, with the irrigated area controlling. Often,\nspecific crops are grown in specific climate, soils, or\ngeographic areas in the project, even to the extent that\na single irrigation method and system may be used.\nFor example, micro irrigation systems are well\nadapted to providing irrigation water to vineyards or\norchards on rocky hillsides. Typical gross irrigation\nwater requirements must then be established for those\nspecific areas. Parameters for expanding on-farm data\nto project wide use include:\n• Water requirement—Water delivery require-\nments need to be established using a planned\nwater delivery schedule and applying manage-\nment flexibility factors. Flow requirements by\nlateral or canal are established, based on\nweighted gross irrigation water requirement on\na per acre basis.\n• When sizing public water distribution laterals,\nremember peak water use for a specific crop\ncan affect only one, two, or portions of several\nlaterals. Averaging peak consumption across\nthe entire area may not be realistic.\n• Project efficiencies—Project water conveyance\nand control facility losses must be analyzed\nwhen determining delivery capacities. These\nlosses can be as high as 50 percent or more in\nlong, unlined, open channels in alluvial soils.\n• In some existing water districts or companies,\nflow through or \"management\" water consti-\ntutes over 30 percent of the canal capacity.\nFlow through water is either returned to natu-\nral water courses as operational spills or added\nto downstream water deliveries. With today's\ntechnology, simple automatic gate/valve con-\ntrol devices can limit flow through water to less\nthan 5 percent.\n• Tailwater redistribution—Collection of field\nrunoff from surface irrigation systems can be\nredistributed to meet lower elevation project\nwater requirements, if allowed by state law.\nQuality of runoff is typically less than that\ndiverted at the source. Irrigation tailwater may\ncontain nutrients, pesticides, and, when surface\nirrigating, highly erosive soils and sediment.\nReuse of runoff water should be strongly con-\nsidered rather than allowing the flow to enter\npublic water. By reusing runoff water either on\nthe farm where it originated or on farms\n(fields) at a lower elevation, overall water use\nefficiency can be improved and diversion flow,\npumpage, or storage reduced. (For more infor-\nmation, see chapter 7). Tailwater collection,\nredistribution, and proper irrigation water\nmanagement need to be part of a resource plan\nthat meets FOTG quality criteria for all re-\nsources.",

However, pumping can be eco-\nnomical for delivery of water to areas at higher eleva-\ntion.\nSufficient elevation drop along a distribution canal or\nlateral often allows replacement of the open channel\nwith a pressurized irrigation pipeline. Benefits as well\nas negative impacts must be assessed as part of the\nplanning process. In some areas, sufficient elevation\ndrop can be available to deliver pressurized water to\noperate low to moderate pressure sprinkler heads and\nfor low pressure micro systems. Local wildlife can\nsuffer when all existing open canals, laterals, and farm\nditches are replaced with buried conduits. Mitigation\nof lost wet areas because of lining or installing con-\nduits should be considered. An environment assess-\nment (EA) or environmental impact statement (EIS)\nmay be needed to adequately assess potential impacts.\nNational Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) poli-\ncies and regulations may apply for project analysis\nwhere potential effects on the environment can occur\nand federal funding is involved.\nObjectives for conveyance, distribution, and delivery\nfacilities should include:\n• Maximizing irrigated acres within physical,\nenvironmental and economic limits\n• Minimizing land disturbance by minimizing\nexcessive cut and fill areas for conveyance\nsystem facilities\n• Providing complete control of all water by:\n— \tReducing canal seepage. Install channel\nlinings or pipelines to reduce seepage\nlosses in high water loss soils.\n— \tReducing operational spills. Use appropri-\nate distribution system water management\nto minimize management or flow through\nwater. Consider semiautomation or full\nautomation as a management tool.\n— \tUsing adequate water measuring devices to\nmeasure flows in all diversion, division,\nand delivery facilities. Equitable delivery of\nwater according to water rights and deliv-\nery schedules is essential for user har-\nmony. Maintaining an adequate record of\nwater diverted and delivered is also essen-\ntial. Irrigation organizations that have\ninstalled water measuring devices on\nlateral and farm turnouts typically experi-\nence from 20 to more than 40 percent\nincrease in usable water. It is human na-\nture to provide a little more water than\nrequired to minimize complaints. Ditch\nriders (person controlling delivery) tend to\nopen the gate a little more when they are\nuncertain about flows. Accurate water\nmeasurement is essential for high level on-\nfarm water management. See discussion on\nwater measuring devices in chapter 9.\n— \tInstalling, operating, and maintaining\nadequate structures for grade control,\nwater level control, and delivery. (See\nUSBR reference Design of Small Canal\nStructures). Consideration should also be\ngiven to automation of control structures\nand valves (see USBR reference Canal\nSystems Automation Manual, 1991). With a\nfully automated system, almost immediate\nadjustments can be made to increase or\ndecrease water availability in a canal or\nconduit system when changes are made in\nwater delivery to the user.

They balance out, and\ngenerally reduce overall diversion require-\nments. Water levels in these reservoirs tend to\nfluctuate widely as inflow and outflow change\nrapidly. An added advantage occurs when the\nwater source is a long distance from the irri-\ngated area. A canal or pipeline can contain\n(store) several acre feet of water that must be\ndelivered, stored, or spilled when many irriga-\ntors discontinue irrigation, for example to\nharvest alfalfa hay, or during an unexpected\nshort rainy period. Check structures or valves\nshould be used to contain or discharge (into\nprotected watercourses) excess water that\ncannot be placed in regulating reservoirs.\n652.0804 \tIrrigation deliv-\nery system automation\nWater conveyance facilities can be automated to\ndeliver irrigation flow rates on demand for most users.\nTypically only a slight to moderate increase in canal or\npipeline capacity is required. Facilities that measure\nand control water surface elevation (or pressure) are\ngenerally quite simple. Headgates and valves can be\ncalibrated to control water surface elevations within\n0.01 feet.\nWith automation, irrigation delivery systems can\noperate at capacity with limited manual adjustments.\nWater deliveries can be interrupted by the user with-\nout jeopardizing the main delivery system. Automation\nencourages better user understanding of plant water\nneeds. When manual water deliveries are changed in\n12- or 24-hour increments, fine tuning water applica-\ntions to meet actual plant water need becomes more\ndifficult. With automation, water can be changed at\nany time.\nWith most delivery systems, at least semiautomation\nof key headgates or valves is appropriate and cost\neffective. Labor to change headgates is reduced.\nExperience has shown that controlling the hydraulic\ngrade line (water surface elevation in open channels)\nimmediately upstream of farm turnouts provides the\nmost accurate water deliveries with the least labor.\nAlso downstream water surface control on laterals\nmakes it easier to divide water between a few users.\nTypically, less water is diverted when agricultural\nwater delivery systems are automated, mainly because\nof more precise control. Automation of urban water\nsystems often use more water because it is delivered\nby a time clock.\nDownstream water control can provide flexible and\ndemand operation. Any change in flow rate within the\nsystem causes upstream gates or pumps to make a\ncorresponding adjustment automatically, until eventu-\nally the gates or pumps at the far upstream supply\npoint respond. Therefore, downstream control is\nlimited to canals or laterals, including pump systems,\nwhich have a flexible supply of water. Downstream",

An example of the latter may be where the\nwater source is a multipump pumping plant at a river\nor reservoir.\nWith downstream control, the water surface or pres-\nsure leaving the structure is controlled. A constant\nwater surface elevation or pressure is maintained at\nsome point downstream of the control facility regard-\nless of the number of turnouts opened.\nThe nature of automated upstream control is to pass\nall problems downstream while maintaining turnout\nflow rate control for all upstream users. With up-\nstream control, the water surface (or pressure) enter-\ning the facility is controlled by opening or closing a\ngate to a lower ditch or pipeline. In open channels,\nbroadcrested weirs can be used to provide constant\ndischarge at a given upstream water surface elevation.\nEnergy for opening and closing small to very large\ngates can use water pressure (head), gravity, electric,\nor pneumatic energy.\nFloats, pressure tapes, pressure transducers, sonic\ntransmitters, and air bubblers are used to sense the\nwater surface elevation. A stilling well is necessary if\nthe water surface fluctuates more than the open/close\ngate tolerance. Typically, the water surface sensing\nunit requires very little energy. A 12 volt DC, deep\ncharge car type battery, or 115 volt AC is generally\nused.\n652.0805 \tWater budget\nA project wide water budget can be an effective tool to\nanalyze total water needs versus total water availabil-\nity. A water surplus or deficit is readily recognized. A\nbudget can show diversion, pumping, or storage re-\nquirements for any selected time period. Typically, a\nmonth-by-month analysis is used for the growing\nseason or entire calendar year. Water budgets can be\ndeveloped for specific items. For example, budget(s)\nmay be developed for: individual system peak crop ET,\nproject wide average crop ET, project wide peak crop\nET, water quality management, or water conservation.\nOften a variety of crops with peak water use require-\nments occurring at different periods of the growing\nseason are grown to reduce peak water delivery needs.\nParameters that might apply to a project wide water\nbudget include:\n• Weighted crop ET requirement.\n• Effective precipitation that changes soil mois-\nture within the plant root zone.\n• Ground water contribution to plant water\nneeds.\n• Net irrigation water requirement (to make up\nsoil moisture deficit).\n• Irrigation efficiency (accounting for unneces-\nsary irrigations, losses to deep percolation and\nrunoff).\n• Auxiliary water requirement (leaching for\nsalinity control; climate control such as frost,\ncooling, or humidity; seed germination).\n• Gross irrigation water requirement.\n• Water conveyance system losses (evaporation,\nphreatophyte plant use, seepage, operational\nspills).\n• Diversion, pumping, and storage requirements.",

In addition to irrigation project\nneeds when using a reservoir, storage may include\nmunicipal, recreation, fire protection, fishery and\nwildlife, sediment retention, flood protection, down-\nstream natural stream flow augmentation, and power\ngeneration.\nDetermining if water is available and can be used for\nirrigation purposes is necessary before spending much\ntime on project planning. This may require a prelimi-\nnary hydrologic analysis and search of issued state\nwater rights. A permit may be required to divert sur-\nface water, install wells and pumps, and to store and\nbeneficially use public water.

Resource treatment and effects\nare considered for each alternative.\n• Develop and evaluate alternatives that lead to\ndecisions to implement and maintain conserva-\ntion treatments and management for the\nproject.\n• Enable sponsors to achieve their objectives as\nwell as meet social, legal, and program require-\nments.\n• Help sponsors develop a plan that meets estab-\nlished project specific quality criteria including\nenvironmental concerns.\n• Assess the effectiveness of installed practices\nin meeting the goals and objectives of the\nsponsors while solving problems and impacts\non environmental values.\n(a) Watershed-based planning\nThe watershed-based planning approach provides a\ncomprehensive process that considers all natural\nresources in the watershed (project) as well as social,\ncultural, and economic factors.

The water-\nshed approach follows the established planning pro-\ncess and empowers local people to recognize prob-\nlems and opportunities and find workable solutions\nfor resolving issues and attaining goals related to\necosystems.

It can assist planning personnel with irrigation\naspects of planning a project. Adherence to the prin-\nciples of the outline will help ensure a uniform ap-\nproach in estimating physical feasibility, benefits,\neffects, and impacts at the various stages of progres-\nsive planning.\nThe outline is not intended to indicate a fixed chrono-\nlogical order or procedure. Many of the investigations\nmay be carried on concurrently. Perform only those\nitems described in the outline that are directly appli-\ncable to appraise the capability of satisfying a compo-\nnent need. The procedural outline is subject to addi-\ntions or deletions should a particular project warrant.\nIntensity of investigations required for various outline\ncomponents varies with the level of planning and the\nscope and significance of the project being planned.\nGenerally, the lowest intensity is associated with pre-\napplication planning level. It increases to full intensity\nfor investigation of the selected plan.\nThe procedural outline does not describe program\nrequirements or format for plan preparation. It pro-\nvides an orderly format for planning, implementation\nand evaluation. As a part of the planning process, it\nprovides an orderly format for organizing information\nto facilitate comparison of alternatives. It also pro-\nvides guidance for writing of plans, organizing sup-\nporting documentation, and facilitating reviews.\nStep 1. Identify problems and concerns\n(scoping process)\nAn interdisciplinary team should review sponsors\napplication and gather and review existing information\nabout the project area and ecosystem(s). They should:\n• Determine environmental, social, economic,\nand cultural resources in the area. Other agen-\ncies and specific interest groups are good\nsources for information.\n• Make a field review of the project area with\nspecific interest in sponsors concerns, but look\nat all natural resources.\n• Obtain input from the public, other agencies,\nand special interest groups. This is generally\nbest done at one or more public meetings. All\npersonnel or groups affected by the project\nshould be interviewed for their real (or per-\nceived) concerns and problems. Small groups\ncan be effective in identifying resources of\nconcern.\nStep 2. Determine objectives\nHelp sponsors develop project planning goals and\nobjectives based on needs and values regarding the\nuse, treatment, and management of available re-\nsources, both onsite and offsite. Establish project\nspecific quality criteria for resources of concern. Use\nor enhance FOTG quality criteria.\nStep 3. Inventory resources\nReview goals and objectives determined in step 2 as\nrelated to land uses, production goals, and problem\nsolving. Tailor inventory detail to expected complexity\nof resource setting. This can be accomplished using\nthe scoping process. Review with sponsors the pur-\npose and importance of the inventory process, what\nshould be done, how much time will be required, and\nwhat documentation will be provided.\nDevelop Plan of Work (POW) outlining; list of tasks,\ndiscipline, time frame to do task, and expected prod-\nuct for each task.\nHave sponsors assist throughout the inventory process\nas much as possible.\nSuggested inventory procedure outline:\nA. \tDevelop project base map\n1. \tIdentify cultural features, communities, roads,\nrailroads, public and private utilities, climatic\nstations, sloughs, ponds, streams, lakes, key\npoints where resource data have been col-\nlected, wildlife preserves, parks\n2. \tTopography or elevations typically one to five\ncontour intervals",

This involves applying\nwater:\n• According to crop needs\n• In amounts that can be held in the soil and be\navailable to crops\n• At rates consistent with the intake characteris-\ntics of the soil and the erosion hazard of the site\n• So that water quality is maintained or improved\nA primary objective in the field of irrigation water\nmanagement is to give irrigation decisionmakers an\nunderstanding of conservation irrigation principles by\nshowing them how they can judge the effectiveness of\ntheir own irrigation practices, make good water man-\nagement decisions, recognize the need to make minor\nadjustments in existing systems, and recognize the\nneed to make major improvements in existing systems\nor to install new systems. The net results of proper\nirrigation water management typically:\n• Prevent excessive use of water for irrigation\npurposes.\n• Prevent excessive soil erosion\n• Reduce labor\n• Minimize pumping costs\n• Maintain or improve quality of ground water and\ndownstream surface water\n• Increase crop biomass yield and product\nquality\nTools, aids, practices, and programs to assist the\nirrigation decisionmaker in applying proper irrigation\nwater management include:\n• Applying the use of water budgets, water bal-\nances, or both, to identify potential water appli-\ncation improvements\n• Applying the knowledge of soil characteristics\nfor water release, allowable irrigation application\nrates, available water capacity, and water table\ndepths\n• Applying the knowledge of crop characteristics\nfor water use rates, growth characteristics, yield\nand quality, rooting depths, and allowable plant\nmoisture stress levels\n• Water delivery schedule effects\n• Water flow measurement for onfield water\nmanagement\n• Irrigation scheduling techniques\n• Irrigation system evaluation techniques\nSee Chapter 15 for resource planning and evaluation\ntools and for applicable worksheets.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–2 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\n652.0901 \tIrrigation water\nmanagement concepts\n(a) Irrigation water management\nconcepts\nField monitoring techniques can be used to establish\nwhen and how much to irrigate. The long existing rule\nof thumb for loamy soils has been that most crops\nshould be irrigated before more than half of the avail-\nable soil water in the crop root zone has been used. It\nhas also been demonstrated that certain crops respond\nwith higher yields and product quality by maintaining a\nhigher available soil-water content, especially with\nclay soils. Desired or allowable soil moisture depletion\nlevels, referred to as Management Allowable Depletion\n(MAD), are described in Chapter 2, Soils, and Chapter\n3, Crops. If the Available Water Capacity (AWC) of the\nsoil, the crop rooting depth for the specific stage of\ngrowth, and the MAD level are known, then how much\nwater to apply per irrigation can be determined. Part\n652.0903 reviews measurement of soil-water content\nand describes tools, techniques, and irrigation schedul-\ning. Part 652.0908, Water management, addresses the\nimportance of measuring a predetermined quantity of\nwater onto the field.\n(1) Concepts of irrigation water management\nThe simplest and basic irrigation water management\ntool is the equation:\nQ T = D A\nwhere:\nQ = flow rate (ft3/s)\nT = time (hr)\nD = depth (in)\nA = area (acres)\nFor example, a flow rate of 1 cubic foot per second for\n1 hour = 1-inch depth over 1 acre. This simple equa-\ntion, modified by an overall irrigation efficiency, can\nbe used to calculate daily water supply needs by\nplants, number of acres irrigable from a source, or the\ntime required to apply a given depth of water from an\nirrigation well or diversion. Typically, over 80 percent\nof IWM concerns can be at least partly clarified by the\napplication of this equation.\nQuantity of water to be applied is often determined by\navailable water capacity of the soil, planned manage-\nment allowable depletion, and estimated crop evapo-\ntranspiration (ET c). When rainfall provides a signifi-\ncant part of seasonal plant water requirements, irriga-\ntion can be used to supplement plant water needs\nduring dry periods resulting from untimely rainfall\nevents.\nWater should be applied at a rate or quantity and in\nsuch a manner to have sufficient soil-water storage, be\nnonerosive, have minimal waste, and be nondegrading\nto public water quality. Irrigations are timed to replace\nthe planned depleted soil moisture used by the crop.\nEffective rainfall during the growing season should be\ntaken into consideration.\n(2) When to irrigate\nWhen to irrigate is dependent on the crop water use\nrate, sometimes referred to as irrigation frequency.\nThis rate can be determined by calculation of ET c rate\nfor specific crop stage of growth, monitoring plant\nmoisture stress levels, monitoring soil-water depletion,\nor a combination if these. Too frequently, crop condi-\ntion is observed to determine when to irrigate. When\nplants show stress from lack of moisture, it is typically\ntoo late. Generally, crop yield and product quality have\nalready been adversely affected. The over-stress\nappearance may also be from shallow roots resulting\nfrom overirriga-tion or from disease, insect damage, or\nlack of trace elements. Certain plants can be exces-\nsively stressed during parts of their growth stage and\nhave little effect on yield. Part 652.0903 reviews mea-\nsurement of plant moisture stress levels and describes\ntools, techniques and irrigation scheduling.\n(3) Rainfall management\nIn moderate to high rainfall areas, managing the timing\nof irrigations to allow effective use of rainfall during\nthe irrigation season is a common practice. The irriga-\ntion decisionmaker can attempt to predict rainfall\nevents and amounts (which too often does not work),\nor the depleted soil water is never fully replaced with\neach irrigation. Instead, between 0.5 and 1.0 inch of\navailable water capacity in the soil profile can be left\nunfilled for storage of potential rainfall. Rainfall prob-\nability during a specific crop growing period and the\nlevel of risk to be taken must be carefully considered\nby the irrigation decisionmaker. Applied irrigation\nwater should always be considered supplemental to\nrainfall events.",

Partial irrigation works\nwell with lower value field crops. It does not work\nwell with high value crops where quality determines\nmarket price, especially the fresh vegetable and fruit\nmarket. Typically, water is applied at times of critical\nplant stress (see Chapter 3, Crops) or until the water is\nno longer available for the season. Yields are generally\nreduced from their potential, but net benefit to the\nfarmer may be highest, especially when using high\ncost water or a declining water source, such as pump-\ning from a declining aquifer. An economic evaluation\nmay be beneficial.\n(5) Water delivery\nWater supply and delivery schedules are key to proper\nirrigation water management. When water users pump\nfrom a well or an adjacent stream or maintain a diver-\nsion or storage reservoir, they control their own deliv-\nery. In some areas delivery is controlled by an irriga-\ntion district or company. Delivery by an irrigation\ndistrict may be controlled by its own institutional\nconstraints (management) or by canal supply and\nstructure capacity limitations.\nFlexibility in delivery generally is controlled by institu-\ntional restraints or capacity limitations on the down-\nstream ends of irrigation laterals. Capacity limitations\nare primarily because required storage is not within or\nvery close to farm delivery locations. Where water\nsupplies are not limited and delivery is in open canal\nsystems, irrigation districts often carry from 10 to 30\npercent additional water through the system as man-\nagement water to reduce district water management\nrequirements. Low cost semi or fully automated con-\ntrollers are available for water control structures that\naccomplish the same purpose with less water. (One\nlarge irrigation district discovered they had over 20\npercent more water available to users when water\nmeasuring devices and semiautomatic gate controls\nwere installed at each major lateral division.) The\nfollowing schedules are widely used.\n(i) \tFixed and rotation—With fixed delivery time\nat fixed delivery rates, irrigation districts provide a\nsingle delivery point to an individual water user or to a\ngroup of neighbors that rotate the delivery among\nthemselves. Generally the delivery schedule is the\neasiest to use and the least costly. Turnout gates are\nadjusted to deliver a given share of water on a con-\ntinual basis. This delivery schedule however, generally\npromotes the philosophy of use the water (whether\nthe crop needs it or not) or lose it. This practice is\nnot conducive to proper irrigation scheduling. Many\nproject delivery systems have been designed based on\nthis delivery schedule method because of the percep-\ntion it allows minimum capacity sizing of all compo-\nnents. When in fact, only the lower end of laterals (± 5\nwater users) is affected.\n(ii) Arranged—The water user requests or orders\nwater delivery at a rate, start time, and duration in\nadvance. Most arranged schedules require a minimum\nof 24 to 48 hours advance notice for water to be turned\non or turned off. Arranged schedules often require\nwater be turned on or off at specific times; i.e., 7 to 9\na.m., to correspond to ditch riders’ schedules. This\ndelivery schedule requires good, advance communica-\ntion between water user and irrigation company.\nIrrigation districts need to have flexibility in their\ndelivery with this method. Temporary storage facilities\nare typically needed because water spills out the end\nof the delivery system.\n(iii) Demand—A demand schedule is one that allows\nusers to have flexibility of frequency, rate, and dura-\ntion of delivery. A municipal water system meets this\ntype of delivery schedule system. It also works best\nwhere the water user owns and maintains the water\nsupply; i.e., well, storage reservoir, and stream diver-\nsion. On-demand schedules are technically feasible for\nmost moderate to large irrigation districts. Except for\ndownstream ends of supply laterals, canal and lateral\nsizes are the same whether demand, rotation, or ar-\nranged deliveries are used. Temporary storage is\nprovided by main canals and laterals; however, canal\nappurtenances (diversions, turnouts, and flow measur-\ning devices) must be sized accordingly. With smaller\ndelivery systems, slight oversizing of main canals and\ntemporary storage facilities can often be provided at a\nsmall increase in delivery system cost. Modifications\nto on-demand schedule can work well. For example,\nthe rate may be limited, but frequency and duration\nmade flexible. This method works quite well in many\nprojects if the main canal capacity is increased slightly\nand if temporary storage facilities are provided within\nthe delivery system.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–4 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nMost onfarm irrigation delivery and distribution facili-\nties are limited by their capacity. Therefore, variable\nfrequency and duration are typically the best delivery\nschedule reasonably available. A good irrigation\nscheduling program can be developed around this type\nof delivery schedule.\n(6) Water measurement\nA key factor in proper irrigation water management is\nknowing how much water is available to apply or is\napplied to a field through an irrigation application\nsystem. Many devices are available to measure open\nchannel or pipeline flows. See Chapter 7, Farm Distri-\nbution Systems, for more details. Too many irrigators\nconsider water measurement a regulation issue and an\ninconvenience. The importance of flow measurement\nfor proper irrigation water management cannot be\noverstressed. Typically, less water is used where\nadequate flow measurement is a part of the water\ndelivery system and a unit cost billing mechanism is\nused. In addition to chapter 7, the joint USBR, ARS,\nand NRCS water measurement publication should be\nconsulted.\n652.0902 \tSoil-plant-water\nbalance\nDetailed soil and crop characteristics were described\nin chapters 2 and 3 of this guide. Applying those char-\nacteristics and monitoring changes in soil-water con-\ntent, plant moisture tension levels, canopy cover, root\ndevelopment, and water use rates provide valuable\nfactors to implement proper irrigation water manage-\nment. Generally, water budgets are a planning tool,\nwater balance is the daily accounting of water avail-\nability. Both can be important irrigation water manage-\nment tools.\n(a) Soil\nSoil intake characteristics, field capacity, wilting point,\navailable water capacity, water holding capacity,\nmanagement allowed depletion, and bulk density are\nsoil characteristics that irrigation consultants and\ndecisionmakers must take into account to implement\nproper irrigation water management. Also see Chapter\n2, Soils, and Chapter 17, Glossary.\nField capacity (FC) is the amount of water remain-\ning in the soil when the downward water flow from\ngravity becomes negligible. It occurs soon after an\nirrigation or rainfall event fills the soil. Field capacity\nis generally assumed to be 1/10 atmosphere (bar) soil-\nwater tension for sandy soils and 1/3 atmosphere (bar)\ntension for medium to fine textured soils. For accurate\nresults these points should be measured in the labora-\ntory, but can be measured (reasonably close) in the\nfield if done soon after an irrigation and before plants\nstart using soil moisture.\nFree or excess water is available for plant use for the\nshort time it is in the soil. With coarse textured soil,\nexcess water can be available for a few hours because\nfree water drains rapidly, but with fine textured soil it\ncan be up to 2 days because free water drains more\nslowly. Laboratory results are typically good for ho-\nmogenous soils, but results may be inaccurate for\nstratified soils because of free water movement being\nrestricted by fine textured layers. In stratified soils,\nproper field tests can provide more representative\ndata.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–5\t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nIn stratified soils, a common perception that down-\nward water movement is held up by fine textured soil\nlayers is not entirely true. In fact, water enters fine\ntextured soil layers almost immediately. However,\nbecause the fine textured soil has greater soil-water\ntension, downward water movement into a coarse\ntextured soil below is restricted. A recently published\nNRCS video, How Water Moves Through Soil, demon-\nstrates water movement in various soil profiles.\nWilting point (WP), sometimes called wilting coeffi-\ncient, is the soil-water content below which plants\ncannot obtain sufficient water to maintain plant\ngrowth and never totally recover. Generally, wilting\npoint is assumed to be 15 atmospheres (bar) tension. It\nis measured only in the laboratory using a pressure\nplate apparatus and is difficult to determine in the\nfield.\nAvailable water capacity (AWC) is that portion of\nwater in the soil (plant root zone) that can be ab-\nsorbed by plant roots. It is the amount of water re-\nleased between field capacity and permanent wilting\npoint, also called available water holding capacity.\nAverage available water capacities are displayed in\ntable 9–1, based on texture in the profile. A specific\nsoil series (i.e., Warden) can have different surface\ntextures. Average soil-water content based on various\ntextures and varying bulk density is displayed in figure\n9–1.\nSoil-water content (SWC) is the water content of a\ngiven volume of soil at any specific time. This is the\nwater content that is measured by most soil-water\ncontent measuring devices.

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–6 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nManagement allowable depletion (MAD) is the\ndesired soil-water deficit at the time of irrigation. It\ncan be expressed as the percentage of available soil-\nwater capacity or as the depth of water that has been\ndepleted in the root zone. Providing irrigation water at\nthis time minimizes plant water stresses that could\nreduce yield and quality.\nBulk density is the mass of dry soil per unit bulk\nvolume. It is the oven dried weight of total material\nper unit volume of soil, exclusive of rock fragments\n2 mm or larger. The volume applies to the soil near\nfield capacity water content. To convert soil-water\ncontent on a dry weight basis to volumetric basis, soil\nbulk density must be used. Bulk density is an indicator\nof how well plant roots are able to extend into the soil.\nSee Chapter 2, Soils, for example of conversion proce-\ndure. Core soil samplers are most commonly used to\ncollect inplace density samples. Commercial samplers\navailable include the Madera sampler in which a 60 cc\nsample is collected. This sampler was developed for\nuse with a neutron probe. The Eley Volumeter and the\nAMS core sampler are other examples. Other commer-\ncial push type core samplers use known volume re-\nmovable retaining cylinders. These cylinders contain\nthe core samples.\nNRCS soil scientists use liquid saran to coat soil clods,\nand the volume of the clod is determined in a soils\nlaboratory using a water displacement technique. This\nprocess provides the least disturbance to a soil\nsample; however, obtaining clods from sandy soils can\nbe difficult. Techniques to determine density used in\nconstruction, such as using a sand cone, and balloon\nmethods can also be used in soils with coarse rock\nfragments or with coarse sandy soils. Rock fragments\ncause disturbance of core samples when using a push\ntype core sampler.\nSoil-water profiles are a plot of soil-water content\nversus soil root zone depth. As a water management\ntool, this plot visually displays available water, total\nwater content, or water content at the time to irrigate\nlevel (fig. 9–2).\nThe rate of decrease in soil-water content is an indica-\ntion of plant water use and evaporation, which can be\nused to determine when to irrigate and how much\nto apply. This is the basic concept in scheduling\nirrigations.\n0\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n1 \t3 \t4 \t2\t\n0\n1 \t2 \t3 \t4 \t5\nSoil moisture (inches/foot)\nCurve number\nWilting point (estimated)\nAvailable moisture\nField capacity (estimated)\nSoil depth (feet)\nFigure 9–2 \tSoil-water content versus depth\tTable 9–1 \tAvailable water capacity for various soil\ntextures\nSoil texture \tEstimated AWC\nin/in \tin/ft\nSand to fine sand \t0.04 \t0.5\nLoamy sand to loamy fine sand \t0.08 \t1.0\nLoamy fine sands, loamy very fine \t0.10 \t1.2\nsands, fine sands, very fine sands\nSandy loam, fine sandy loam \t0.13 \t1.6\nVery fine sandy loam, silt loam, silt \t0.17 \t2.0\nClay loam, sandy clay loam, \t0.18 \t2.2\nsilty clay loam\nSandy clay, silty clay, clay \t0.17 \t2.0",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–7\t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nAn interpretation of data that soil moisture curves 1\nthrough 4 on figure 9–2 represent includes:\n• Curve #1—This curve shows the upper 6 inches\nof the soil profile is below wilting point. Shallow\nrooted plants are excessively stressed. Below a\ndepth of 12 inches, soil moisture is still ample at\n50 percent. If it is desirable to maintain soil\nmoisture at 50 percent of total available moisture\nor higher (i.e., for plants with less than 10 inches\nrooting depth), it is time to irrigate, maybe even a\nlittle late to maintain optimum growth condi-\ntions. Deeper rooted plants are still drawing\nmoisture from below a depth of 12 inches.\n• Curve #2—This curve represents what soil mois-\nture may be a day or two after an irrigation. The\nlower part of the soil profile did not reach field\ncapacity. However, this situation may be desir-\nable for crops with less than 25-inch rooting\ndepth. For deeper rooted crops, additional water\nshould have been applied.\n• Curve #3—This curve represents moisture with-\ndrawal from shallow rooted plants. There is\nample moisture below 12 inches. A light applica-\ntion of water, to 12 inches depth, is needed for\nshallow rooted plants. A heavy application of\nwater could put excess water below the crop\nroot zone.\n• Curve #4—This curve represents what soil mois-\nture may be a day or two after an irrigation. The\nsoil profile below a depth of 12 inches is nearly\nat field capacity, indicating a good irrigation\napplication to approximately a 4-foot depth.\nWater is probably still moving downward.\n(b) Measuring soil-water content\nTo measure soil-water content change for the purpose\nof scheduling irrigation, several site locations in each\nfield and each horizon (or if homogenous at 6 inch\ndepth increments) at the site (test hole) should be\nsampled. Quite often, the experienced irrigation\ndecisionmaker calibrates available soil water in the\nsoil profile relative to one sample at a specific depth.\nMultiple sites in a field are used to improve confidence\nin determining when and how much water to apply.\nMost commercial soil-water content measuring de-\nvices provide a numerical measurement range. This\nmeasurement range is an indication of relative water\ncontent. The range might be 0 to 100 percent AWC or 0\nto 10. Readings represent different specific soil-water\ncontent depending on soil type. Most devices that\nindicate relative values are difficult to calibrate to\nrelate to specific quantitative values. A calibration\ncurve for each specific kind of soil and soil-water\ncontent (tension) should be available with the device\nor needs to be developed.\nIf the irrigator is only interested in knowing when to\nirrigate, a specific indicated value on the gauge or\nmeter may be sufficient. The manufacturer may pro-\nvide this information either prebuilt into the device or\nwith separate calibration curves. Irrigators must know\nwhat number (value) on the meter represents what\napproximate soil-water content level for their field and\nsoils. They then must associate a specific number on\nthe gauge to when irrigation is needed for each soil\ntexture. Irrigation system design and water manage-\nment planning provide the how much to apply. Ex-\nample worksheets are provided in Chapter 15, Plan-\nning and Evaluation Tools.\n(1) Methods and devices to measure or esti-\nmate soil-water content\n(i) \tSoil feel and appearance method—This\nmethod is easy to implement and with experience can\nbe accurate. Soil samples are collected in the field at\ndesired depths, typically at 6 inch increments. Samples\nare compared to tables or pictures that give moisture\ncharacteristics of different soil textures in terms of\nfeel and appearance. With practice, estimates can be\nobtained within 10 percent of actual. Typically the\nirrigation decisionmaker needs to learn only a few\nsoils and textures.\nExhibit 9–1 displays the identification of soils and\ncorresponding available water content when using feel\nand appearance method for determining soil-water\ncontent. The NRCS color publication, Estimating Soil\nMoisture by Feel and Appearance, is reproduced in\nchapter 15. Figure 9–3 is an example worksheet for\ndetermining soil-water deficient (SWD) in the soil\nprofile.\nEvery operation can afford tools necessary to use this\nmethod of soil-water determination. Tools required are\na push type core sampler, auger, or shovel. Care\nshould be taken to not mix soil layers when sampling.\nExample forms for recording field data and calculating\ndepleted or available soil-water content are in chapter\n15.",

Care must be taken to\nprotect soil samples from drying before they are\nweighed. Samples are taken to the office work room,\nweighed (wet weight), ovendried, and weighed again\n(dry weight). An electric oven takes 24 hours at 105\ndegrees Celsius to adequately remove soil water. A\nmicrowave oven takes a few minutes. Excessive high\ntemperatures can degrade the soil sample by burning\norganic material. The drying oven can exhaust mois-\nture from several samples at one time, but the micro-\nwave typically dries only one or two samples at a time.\nPercentage of total soil-water content on a dry weight\nbasis is computed. To convert to a volumetric basis,\nthe percentage water content is multiplied by the soil\nbulk density. Available soil water is calculated by\nsubtracting percent total soil water at wilting point.\nTools required to use this method are a core sampler\nor auger, soil sample containers (airtight plastic bags\nor soil sample tins with tight lids), weighing scales,\nand a drying oven. Soil moisture will condense inside\nplastic bags, when used. This is part of the total soil\nmoisture in the sample and must be accounted for in\nthe weighing and drying operation. Standard electric\nsoils drying ovens are commercially available. A much\nshorter drying time can be used with a microwave\noven or infrared heat lamp, but samples need to be\nturned and weighed several times during drying to\ncheck water loss. Samples should be allowed to cool\nbefore weighing. These drying procedures are more\nlabor intensive than using a standard drying oven at\n105 degrees Celsius. Figure 9–4 displays an example\nworksheet for determining soil-water content of the\nsoil profile.\n(iii) Carbide soil moisture tester—A carbide soil\nmoisture tester (sometimes called Speedy Moisture\nTester) can provide percent water content of soil\nsamples in the field; however, practice is necessary to\nprovide satisfactory and consistent results. The tester\nis commercially available. Typically, a 26-gram soil\nsample and a measure of calcium carbide are placed in\nthe air tight container. Some models use a 13-gram\nsample. When calcium carbide comes in contact with\nwater in the soil, a gas (oxy-acetylene, C 2H2) develops.\nAs the reaction takes place, the gas develops a pres-\nsure in the small air tight container. The amount of gas\ndeveloped is related to amount of water in the soil\nsample (providing excess carbide is present).\nCaution: If inadequate carbide is available to react\nwith all of the water, indicated moisture content is\nlow. The higher the water content, the higher the\npressure. The tester provides a gauge that reads per-\ncent soil-water content on a wet-weight basis. A stan-\ndard chart is available to convert percent soil-water\ncontent from wet weight basis to dry weight basis.\nFigure 9–4 displays an example worksheet for deter-\nmining soil-water content of the soil profile. The\nworksheet shown in figure 9–5 can help determine soil\nmoisture and bulk density using the Eley volumeter\nand carbide moisture tester. Table 9–2 displays oven\ndry moisture content, Pd , based on meter gauge read-\ning, WP . This instrument measures total water held in\nthe soil sample. To obtain AWC, subtract water held at\nW P.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–14 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\n(iv) Tensiometers (moisture stake)—Soil-water\npotential (tension) is a measure of the amount of\nenergy with which water is held in the soil. Tensiom-\neters are water filled tubes with hollow ceramic tips\nattached on the lower end and a vacuum gauge on the\nupper end. The container is air tight at the upper end.\nThe device is installed in the soil with the ceramic tip\nin contact with the soil at the desired depth. The water\nin the tensiometer comes to equilibrium with soil\nwater surrounding the ceramic tip. Water is pulled out\nof the ceramic tip by soil-water potential (tension) as\nsoil water is used by plants. This creates a negative\npressure (vacuum) in the tube that is indicated on the\nvacuum gauge. When the soil is rewetted, the tension\ngradient reduces, causing water to flow from the soil\ninto the ceramic tip.\nThe range of tension created by this devise is 0 to 100\ncentibars (0 to 1 atmospheres). Near 0 centibars is\nconsidered field capacity, or near 0 soil water tension.\nPractical operating range is 0 to 80 centibars. The\nupper limit of 80 centibars corresponds to about: 90\npercent AWC depletion for a sandy soil and about 30\npercent AWC depletion for medium to fine textured\nsoils. This limits the practical use of tensiometers to\nmedium to fine textured soils with high frequency\nirrigation or where soil-water content is maintained at\nhigh levels. Tensiometers break suction if improperly\ninstalled and if the soil-water tension exceeds practi-\ncal operating limits, typically 80 to 85 centibars. Once\nvacuum is broken, the tube must be refilled with water\nand the air removed by using a small hand-operated\nvacuum pump. A period to establish tensiometer-soil-\nwater stability follows.\nTensiometers require careful installation, and mainte-\nnance is required for reliable results. They must also\nbe protected against freeze damage. Maintenance kits\nthat include a hand vacuum pump are required for\nservicing tensiometers. The hand pump is used to\ndraw out air bubbles from the tensiometer and provide\nan equilibrium in tension. Tensiometers should be\ninstalled in pairs at each site, at one-third and two-\nthirds of the crop rooting depth. A small diameter\nauger (or half-inch steel water pipe) is required for\nmaking a hole to insert the tensiometer. Figure 9–6\nshows a tensiometer and gauge and illustrates installa-\ntion and vacuum pump servicing. Tensiometers are\ncommercially and readily available at a reasonable\ncost.\nWhen installing tensiometers, make a heavy paste\nfrom part of the soil removed at the depth the ceramic\ntip is to be placed. When the hole has been augured\nabout 2 inches below the desired depth of the ceramic\ntip, the paste is placed in the hole. As you install the\ntensiometer tube, move the tube up and down a few\ntimes to help assure good soil paste contact with the\nceramic tip. Do not handle or touch the ceramic tip as\ncontamination from material and body oil on the\nhands affects water tension on the tip. If the soil is wet\nat the desired ceramic tip depth, tensiometers can be\ninstalled by driving a rod or 0.5-inch diameter galva-\nnized iron pipe to the desired depth. The end of the\ndriving rod should be shaped the same as, but slightly\nsmaller than the tensiometer tip. Pour a little water in\nthe hole, move the driving rod up and down a few\ntimes to develop a soil paste at the bottom of the hole.\nInsert tensiometer tube, move the tube up and down a\nfew times to help assure good soil paste contact with\nthe ceramic tip.\nTensiometers installed at different rooting depths have\ndifferent gauge readings because of soil water poten-\ntial change in rooting depths. With uniform deep soil,\nabout 70 to 80 percent of soil moisture withdrawal by\nplant roots is in the upper half of the rooting depth.\nRecommended depths for setting tensiometers are\ngiven in table 9–3.\nTable 9–3 \tRecommended depths for setting tensiometers\nPlant root \tShallow \tDeep\nzone depth \ttensiometer \ttensiometer\n(in) \t(in) \t(in)\n18 \t8 \t12\n24 \t12 \t18\n36 \t12 \t24\n> 48 \t18 \t36",

When buried and in close contact with\nthe surrounding soil, water in the block comes to\nwater tension equilibrium with the surrounding soil.\nOnce equilibrium is reached, different properties of\nthe block affected by its water content can be mea-\nsured. Electrical resistance blocks work best between\n0 and 2 atmospheres (bars). Thus, they have a wider\noperating range than do tensiometers, but are still\nlimited to medium to coarse textured soils.\nElectrical resistance blocks are buried in the soil at\ndesired depths. Intimate contact by the soil is essen-\ntial. With porous blocks, electrical resistance is mea-\nsured across the block using electrodes encased in the\nblock. Electrical resistance is affected by the water\ncontent of the block, which is a function of the soil-\nwater tension. Electrical resistance is measured with\nan ohm meter calibrated to provide numerical read-\nings for the specific type of block. Higher resistance\nreadings mean lower water content, thus higher soil-\nwater tension. Lower resistance readings indicate\nhigher water content and lower soil-water tension.\nGypsum blocks are affected by soil salinity, which\ncause misleading readings, and are prone to break-\ndown in sodic soils. They are best suited to medium\nand fine texture soils. Being made of gypsum, the\nblocks slowly dissolve with time in any soil. The rate is\ndependent upon pH and soil-water quality. Freezing\ndoes not seem to affect them. Blocks made from other\nmaterial do not dissolve; therefore, have a longer life.\nElectrical resistance blocks are relatively low cost and\nwith reasonable care are easy to install. Close contact\nwith soil is important.\nInstallation tools required are a small diameter auger\nfor making a hole for inserting blocks, a wooden\ndowel to insert blocks, and water and a container for\nmixing soil paste. (Multiple electrical resistance\nblocks can be installed in the same auger hole.) After\nthe hole has been augured to about 2 inches below the\ndeepest block installation depth, a soil paste is made\nfrom removed soil and placed about 6 inches deep in\nthe bottom of the hole. Wet resistance block with\nclean water.\nHandling or touching the electrical resistance block\nmay affect soil moisture readings. With the electrical\nresistance block carefully held on the end of the dowel\nby the wires, place the block in the hole at the desired\ndepth with a slight up and down movement to help\nassure soil paste contact with the block. Check for\nbroken wires with an electric meter. Hold the electric\nwires along the side of the hole and carefully fill the\nhole with soil. Soil should be replaced by layers. It\nshould be from the same layer from which it was\nremoved. Repeat soil paste and block procedure at\neach electrical resistance block depth.\nWhen electrical resistance blocks are located properly,\nalmost anyone can obtain readings. One person with a\nmeter can provide readings for many field test sites.\nWhere farms are small, neighbors can share a single\nmeter. Following each reading a report is developed\nand given to each farm irrigation decisionmaker. The\nirrigation decisionmaker must learn to interpret meter\nreadings to decide the right time to irrigate.\nElectrical resistance blocks and resistance meters\n(battery powered) are commercially and readily avail-\nable. Table 9–4 displays interpretations of readings\nfrom a typical electrical resistance meter.\n(vi) Thermal dissipation blocks—These blocks\nare porous ceramic materials in which a small heater\nand temperature sensors are imbedded. This allows\nmeasurement of the thermal dissipation of the block,\nor the rate at which heat is conducted away from the\nheater. This property is directly related to the water\ncontent of the block and thus soil-water content.\nThermal dissipation blocks must be individually cali-\nbrated. They are sensitive to soil-water content across\na wide range. Meter readings can be used directly, or\ntranslated using manufacturer’s charts to soil-water\ntension. Specific meters are to be used with specific\ntype of blocks.",

Hydrogen is a key element in water (i.e., H 2O).\nThe device is commonly called a neutron probe. The\nprobe itself consists of a radioactive source that emits\n(scatters) high energy neutrons and a slow speed\nneutron detector housed in a unit that is lowered into\na permanent access tube installed in the soil. The\nprobe is connected by a cable to a control unit (neu-\ntron gauge) remaining at the surface. The control unit\nincludes electronics for time control, a neutron\ncounter, memory, and other electronics for processing\nreadings.\nFast neutrons, emitted from the source and passing\nthrough the access tube into the surrounding soil,\ngradually lose their energy (and speed) through colli-\nsions with hydrogen molecules. The result is a mass of\nslowed or thermalized neutrons, some of which diffuse\nback to the detector. The detector physically counts\nreturned neutrons. The number of slow neutrons\ncounted in a specific interval of time is directly related\nTable 9–4 \tInterpretations of readings on typical electrical resistance meter\nSoil water \tMeter \tInterpretation\ncondition \treadings 1/\n(0 – 200 scale)\nNearly saturated \t180 – 200 \tNear saturated soil often occurs for a few hours following an irrigation.\nDanger of water logged soils, a high water table, or poor soil aeration if\nreadings persists for several days.\nField capacity \t170 – 180 \tExcess water has mostly drained out.

A higher count indicates\nhigher soil-water content, and a lower count indicates\nlower soil-water content.\nWhen properly calibrated and operated, the neutron\ngauge can be the most accurate and most repeatable\nmethod of measuring soil-water content. When plot-\nted, count versus soil-water content is a linear rela-\ntionship. The gauge as it comes from the manufacturer\nis calibrated to a general kind of soil (medium texture)\nand to a medium soil bulk density. A microprocessor\ncalculates soil-water content in acre-inches or percent,\ndry weight basis. However, the gauge must be cali-\nbrated for inplace soils and type of access tube mate-\nrial being used; i.e., PVC, aluminum, or steel. Calibra-\ntion is done using gravimetric sampling procedures.\nAlso, for any soil texture other than what the device\nwas calibrated to by the manufacturer, or with widely\nvarying bulk density, the device must be recalibrated.\nThis is a time consuming process in layered soils on\nalluvial sites where the texture and bulk density vary\nwidely. Recalibration is generally not necessary in\nmedium textured, medium bulk density, uniform soils.",

Field capacity and\nwilting point levels must be known. It is more conve-\nnient if field measurements could be taken near those\nsoil-water content levels. The neutron gauge method is\nhighly accurate (1 to 2 percent of actual) if properly\noperated and adequately calibrated except:\n• in the upper 6 inches of soil profile where fast\nneutrons tend to escape above the soil surface;\n• in high clay content soil that contain tightly\nbound hydrogen ions that are not reflected in the\ndetecting process;\n• in soil with high organic matter content; and\n• in soil containing boron ions.\nThese soil conditions all require recalibration of the\ngauge. Chapter 15 contains example worksheets,\ntypical calibration curves, and sample displays for soil-\nwater content by depth relationships.\nBecause a neutron gauge contains a radiation source\nand is a potential safety hazard to a technician using a\ngauge, special licensing, operator training, handling,\nshipping, and storage are required. The wearing of a\nradioactive detecting film badge is required by all\ntechnicians when handling and using a neutron gauge.\nThe use of a neutron gauge is not to be taken lightly.\nNRCS operates under a site license held by the USDA\nAgricultural Research Service. Inspections of storage\nfacilities are made periodically. Disposal of old neu-\ntron probes (radioactive source) is strictly controlled\nby U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).\nA neutron probe is recommended for large farms or\nfarm groups where use efficiency and accuracy can\njustify high initial cost, maintenance, and operating\nunder NRC requirements.\nTools needed are:\n• Approved storage facility for the probe at the\nworkshop and in the vehicle\n• Small diameter soil auger\n• Soil bulk density sampler\n• Watertight access tubes that fit snugly against\nthe soil\n• Gravimetric soil sampling equipment (core\nsampler, auger, sample bags, weighing scales,\ndrying oven) for calibration\n• Neutron gauge\n• Small square of canvas\n• Tool box containing a variety of tools\n• Film badges for everyone involved\n(vii) Diaelectric constant method—The diaelectric\nconstant of material is a measure of the capacity of a\nnonconducting material to transmit high frequency\nelectromagnetic waves or pulses. The diaelectric\nconstant of a dry soil is between 2 and 5. The diaelec-\ntric constant of water is 80 at frequency range of 30\nMHz – 1 GHz. Relatively small changes in the quantity\nof free water in the soil have large effects on the\nelectromagnetic properties of the soil-water media.\nTwo approaches developed for measuring the\ndiaelectric constant of the soil-water media (water\ncontent by volume) are time domain reflectometry\n(TDR) and frequency domain reflectometry (FDR).\nFor TDR technology used in measuring soil-water\ncontent, the device propagates a high frequency trans-\nverse electromagnetic wave along a cable attached to\nparallel conducting probes inserted into the soil. A\nTDR soil measurement system measures the average\nvolumetric soil-water percentage along the length of a\nwave guide. Wave guides (parallel pair) must be care-\nfully installed in the soil with complete soil contact\nalong their entire length, and the guides must remain\nparallel. Minimum soil disturbance is required when\ninserting probes. This is difficult when using the\ndevice as a portable device. The device must be prop-\nerly installed and calibrated. Differing soil texture,\nbulk density, and salinity do not appear to affect the\ndiaelectric constant.\nFDR approaches to measurement of soil-water content\nare also known as radio frequency (RF) capacitance\ntechnique. This technique actually measures soil\ncapacitance. A pair of electrodes is inserted into the\nsoil. The soil acts as the diaelectric completing a\ncapacitance circuit, which is part of a feedback loop of\na high frequency transistor oscillator. The soil capaci-\ntance is related to the diaelectric constant by the\ngeometry of the electric field established around the\nelectrodes. Changes in soil-water content cause a shift\nin frequency. University and ARS comparison tests\nhave indicated that, as soil salinity increases, sensor\nmoisture values were positively skewed, which sug-\ngests readings were wetter than actual condition.",

Probe use is difficult in drier soil of any\ntexture, soils with coarse fragments, or soils with\nhardpans. A pilot hole may need to be made using an\nauger. The probe provides an analog, color-coded dial\ngauge (for three soil types—sand, loam, and clay), or a\ndigital readout. The volume of soil measured is rela-\ntively small (a cylinder 4 inches tall by 1 inch in diam-\neter). Several sites in a field should be measured, and\ncan be, because probes are rapid and easy to use.\nProper soil/probe tip contact is essential for accurate\nand consistent readings.\nPortable device that uses an access tube similar to a\nneutron gauge—The probe suspended on a cable is\ncentered in an access tube at predetermined depths\nwhere the natural resonant frequency or frequency\nshift between the emitted and received frequency is\nmeasured by the probe. The standard access tube is\n2-inch diameter schedule 40 PVC pipe. Installation of\nthe access tube requires extreme care to ensure a snug\nfit between the tube and the surrounding soil. Air gaps\nor soil cracks between the tube and soil induce error.\nThe device is calibrated by the manufacturer to sand\nand to an average bulk density for sand.

The volume of soil measured is not texture or\nwater content dependent, and approximates a cylinder\n4 inches tall and 10 inches in diameter. Accuracy can\nbe good in some soils with proper installation and\ncalibration, and there are no radioactive hazards to\npersonnel such as when using a neutron gauge. Proper\ninstallation of the access tube is essential and can be\nquite time consuming. Accuracy of data is largely\ndependent on having a tight, complete contact be-\ntween the access tube and the surrounding soil. Before\nmaking a large investment in equipment, it is highly\nrecommended that adequate research be done on\ncomparison evaluations that are in process by various\nuniversities and the ARS. Good sources of information\nare technical papers and proceedings of ASAE, ASCE,\nand Soil Science Society of America, as well as direct\ndiscussion with personnel doing evaluations.\nOther electronic sensors—Numerous sensors are\ncommercially available using microelectronics.

Those character-\nistics necessary for implementing a proper irrigation\nwater management program include purpose of crop,\ncrop evapotranspiration, critical growth periods, and\nroot development.\n(1) Crop evapotranspiration\nCrop evapotranspiration (ETc) is the amount of water\nused by the crop in transpiration building of plant\ntissue and evaporated from the soil or plant foliage\nsurface. It is determined by using local climatic factors\nand stage of growth. Several equations can be used\ndepending on climate data availability and degree of\nintensity of IWM program. ETc provides one of the key\ningredients in scheduling irrigations; i.e., how much\nwater the crop uses or is projected to use.",

Most crops are sensitive to water\nstress during one or more critical growth periods\nduring their growing season. If adequate moisture is\nnot available during the critical period(s), irreversible\nloss of yield or product quality results. With many fruit\nand fresh vegetable crops, lack of available water at\ncritical growth periods can result in a product that\nmay be partly or totally unmarketable on the fresh\nmarket because of poor quality. See Chapter 3, Crops,\nfor critical growth stages, and chapter 15 for IWM\ntools.\n(3) Root development\nRoots develop as plants grow and mature. Major\nfactors controlling root development are stage of plant\ngrowth, usable soil depth, soil compaction, soil condi-\ntion, and amount of water in the soil. Irrigation should\nbe planned to provide water only to the usable plant\nroot zone unless leaching for salinity control is neces-\nsary.\nNever assume a plant root zone depth. Observe and\nmeasure the actual depth roots penetrate a soil profile\nby digging a shallow pit and auguring. Notice the\npattern of root development in the side of the pit.\nCheck for roots in handfuls of augured soil. Generally\n2 to 4 feet of total depth is adequate. If root develop-\nment pattern depth is overestimated, an overirrigation\nrecommendation is guaranteed. Plants will show\nunneeded stress between irrigations.\n(4) Yield (quality) versus water use relation-\nships\nMost crops respond to water availability and use to\nprovide a given biomass or yield. Limited data are\navailable for predicting specific yield versus water use\nrelationships except for a few crops. With most crops,\nyield and product quality are reduced where excess\nwater is applied. Too much water can also be detri-\nmental to crop yield by leaching of otherwise available\nplant nutrients below the root zone. Water is also\nwasted. Tables or curves for several crops are in\nChapter 3, Crops.\nThe following methods and devices are commercially\navailable to measure plant moisture tension levels.\nThey can provide indications of plant moisture stress.\n(i) \tCrop Water Stress Index (CWSI)—The crop\nwater stress gun measures plant canopy (foliage),\ntemperature, ambient air temperature, relative humid-\nity, and a range of solar radiation. The CWSI gun is\ncommonly mistakenly called infrared gun or IR ther-\nmometer. In the CWSI gun a microprocessor calcu-\nlates plant water stress and expresses it as an index\nfrom 0 to 1.0 or 0 to 10, depending upon the manufac-\nturer. (The latter avoids using a decimal. Overall range\nis the same.) Threshold stress levels are developed for\neach crop for determining when to irrigate. Once\ndeveloped, the stress index for a specific crop appears\nto be usable in all climate zones and for similar crop\nspecies. When first used in an area, it is best to affirm\ncalibration based upon local conditions. When the\ncanopy temperature in relation with other climate\nfactors increases to a predetermined upper target\nlevel, the plants are considered stressed. A well wa-\ntered plant has relative cool foliage because of the\ncontinual plant transpiration and has an index near\nzero. When plant canopy temperature reaches ambient\ntemperature, the plant is not transpiring moisture and\nis probably beyond permanent wilting point. When\nfollowing good water management practices, the\nirrigator can provide irrigations before upper target\nthreshold stress levels are reached.\nPeriodic soil-water content checks should be made to\nrelate plant water stress indexes and soil-water con-\ntent levels. Observe and measure the depth of plant\nroots. Adequate soil moisture may be present below\nthe plant root zone. CWSI readings can be observed\nover several days to predict the need for irrigation 3 to\n5 days in advance.\nThis device is relatively easy to use and can provide\nrapid results at varied locations in a field. Proper\ntechniques for use are important. Readings can be\ntaken when the sky is clear or overcast, but not\nclouded over. The best time is midmorning to early\nafternoon, and the foliage must be dry. Readings must\nbe taken only of foliage, not bare soil, landscape, sky,\nor other factors. Average several readings to improve\naccuracy. The gun is held at least 1 meter above the\ncrop canopy, but not more than 10 meters. Direct the\ndevice more or less down onto the crop canopy. This\ncreates a challenge with tall crops (corn, cotton, fruit,\ncitrus, nuts). Caution must be exercised because\napparent high stress levels may be from factors other\nthan moisture, such as insects and disease. The user",

Several models are commer-\ncially available. Different crops have different target\nstress levels.\nTechnology exists to provide CWSI readings from\naircraft and satellite. Current limitations include\ngetting information into the hands of the irrigation\ndecisionmaker for timely irrigation water management\ndecisions. Other uses of the CWSI gun include identifi-\ncation of plant stress before visual observation signs\nappear. Observing irrigation uniformity across the\nfield and damage from crop insects, fungus (including\nroot rot), and rodents are a few other uses.\n(ii) Leaf moisture stress (pressure chamber)—\nThis method involves encasing a part of the plant, such\nas a leaf, inside a pressure chamber, and checking the\namount of pressure required to force the fluid stored\nin the sample back out the stem. Nitrogen gas is typi-\ncally used. The pressure required to reverse the flow\nof plant moisture is interpreted to indicate plant mois-\nture tension (stress). Target tension (stress) points\nmust be developed for specific plants, after which it\ncan be used as a reference for subsequent tests. Suc-\ncess of this method depends on standardization of the\ntest protocol. It is desirable to take readings at pre-\ndawn. Predawn plant water tension is controlled by\nsoil-water tension, and daytime plant moisture tension\nis controlled by climate. Plant moisture stress can be\nseveral times higher during the heat of the day than at\npredawn and not be consistent at any specific time of\nday for each day. Sun angle, cloud cover, temperature,\nhumidity, and wind all affect plant moisture tension\nlevels during daylight hours.\n(iii) Evaporimeter (atmometer)—An evaporimeter\nconsists of a flat, porous ceramic disk (Bellani plate)\nin which water is drawn up by capillary action as\nwater is evaporated from the disk. It is used to directly\nestimate crop evapotranspiration rate. Several com-\nmercial models can be easily installed near the edge of\na field or on a roadway in a field. (The unit must be\nlocated far enough into the field to avoid field bound-\nary effects.) One commercial model provides a green\ncanvas-like material covering the ceramic disc to\nsimulate crop leaf color. Reasonably good correlation\nhas been found between field measurements and that\ncalculated from Penman-type equations. Small differ-\nence in evaporation rates may be found between\nindividual meters. Maintaining water levels and re-\nmoval for freeze protection are necessary.\n(iv) Evaporation pans—U.S. Weather Bureau Class\nA evaporation pans are standard sized, opentop metal\nwater containers. Water is evaporated from a satu-\nrated source (water body) with solar energy. Coeffi-\ncients must be applied to the evaporation rate repre-\nsenting pan coefficients and crop growth stage coeffi-\ncients. Nonstandard pans have been tried with varying\ndegrees of success. Materials range from galvanized\nmetal wash tubs to PVC pipe (placed vertically). The\ndevices are generally calibrated to a local Class A\nevaporation pan, and can be reasonably effective in\ndetermining when to irrigate. Coefficients are applied\nto the pan evaporation rate to represent crop evapo-\ntranspiration rate.\n(v) \tInfrared photography—Aerial infrared pho-\ntography can show current plant condition by the\ndarkness of green vegetation. Red color intensity on\nphoto prints displays dark green and lighter green\npatterns in the vegetation. Infrared photography is a\nvaluable tool to visually observe local areas within an\nirrigation system or field(s) that receive either insuffi-\ncient or excess irrigation water. Red color intensity\ndifferences can result from:\n• Wrong sized or plugged nozzles or broken sprin-\nkler heads giving poor distribution patterns\n• Shallow or coarse textured soil areas\n(inclusions)\n• Insect, fungus, or disease damage\nSome skill is required to interpret color intensity on\ninfrared photo prints. Plant canopy (foliage) tempera-\nture measured with a crop water stress gun may also\nbe helpful.\n(vi) Visual—Observation of plant condition is too\noften the only basis used for determining when a crop\nneeds irrigated. By the time leaf color or degree of curl\nindicates the need of water, the plant generally is\noverstressed and yield and product quality are nega-\ntively affected. However, certain crops can be stressed\nat noncritical growth stages with little effect on yield.\nSome well-watered crops normally show visual signs\nof stress at or following solar noon on hot days.\nOverirrigation, especially early in the growing season,\nlimits plant root development volume and depth,\nwhich limits the volume of soil containing water\navailable for plant use. Often adequate soil water\nexists below existing plant root systems, but roots\ncannot grow rapidly enough to obtain adequate mois-\nture to maintain plant evapotranspiration and growth.",

Corn is\noften used as a moisture stress indicator plant because\nit shows stress several days before many other crops.\nMany other indicator plants can be used. See Chapter\n3, Crops.\n(d) Upward water movement\n(upflux)\nWhen a water table exists close to the root zone, crops\nextract water from the capillary fringe or water mov-\ning upward (upflux) into the crop root zone. The rate\nof upward flow depends primarily on the depth to the\nwater table and soil texture. See Chapter 6, Irrigation\nSystem Design, for additional discussion.\n652.0903 \tIrrigation\nscheduling\n(a) General\nIrrigation scheduling is that part of proper irrigation\nwater management involving the decision, when to\nirrigate and how much water to apply. Scheduling\ntools provide information that irrigation decision-\nmakers can use to develop irrigation strategies for\neach field on the farm. Such strategies may be based\non long-term data, representing average conditions, or\nmay be developed as the season progresses, using real\ntime information and short-time predictions. In both\ncases information about the crop, soil, climate, irriga-\ntion system, water deliveries, and management objec-\ntives must be considered to tailor irrigation scheduling\nprocedures to a specific irrigation decisionmaker and\nfield condition. An irrigation scheduling tool needs\nonly be accurate enough to make the decision when\nand how much to irrigate.\nThe need for proper irrigation water management,\nincluding irrigation scheduling, can best be demon-\nstrated by identifying physical effects. To be most\neffective, identify the physical effects the irrigation\ndecisionmaker is most concerned about, then show\nhow proper irrigation water management will affect\nthe concerns. The concerns include:\n• Energy cost per season (fuel or electricity)\n• Irrigation labor (kind of labor, timing, and\namount)\n• Wear and tear on irrigation equipment\n• Plant response (yield) compared to potential\n• Quality of product or crop\n• Amount of irrigation water used\n• Soil condition\n• Plant response to fertilizer used\n• Water quality onsite or offsite\nModern scheduling is based on soil-water balance or\ncrop-water balance for one or more points in the field.\nBy measuring existing and estimating future soil-water\ncontent or monitoring crop-water stress level, irriga-\ntion water can be applied before damaging crop stress\noccurs.

Other techniques used\nto monitor current crop condition, such as infrared\nphotography and leaf and plant moisture stress level\nindex typically do not include a continual monitoring\nof soil-water content. Periodic checking of soil mois-\nture status is generally sufficient to validate or update\nscheduling model.\nThe producer's management objective must be consid-\nered when developing a scheduling program. Maximiz-\ning net return is a common objective; other objectives\nmay be to minimize irrigation costs, maximize yield,\nuse less water, minimize ground water and down-\nstream surface water pollution, optimize production\nfrom a limited water supply, use less energy for pump-\ning, or to improve product quality.\nSeveral scheduling techniques and levels of sophistica-\ntion can be applied to track the amount of soil water in\nthe crop root zone and crop water use. In some loca-\ntions crop water use information is made available via\nnewspapers, telephone call-in, television, or by com-\nputer modem systems. All irrigation scheduling pro-\ngrams should account for rainfall measured at the field\nsite. Because of the spatial variation in rainfall,\namount recorded at the farmstead or in town often\ndoes not represent precipitation at the field site. With\nprecipitation (usually rainfall) at the field site known,\naccuracy for scheduling irrigations is improved. The\namount available to meet plant water needs is called\neffective precipitation.\nIn addition to soil water to plant relationships, other\nfactors are important in selecting a method of schedul-\ning irrigations and setting up the scheduling proce-\ndures. Labor skill, availability, and personal interest\ndictate what type and level of intensity for readings\nand calculations can be made to make the scheduling\nprocedure work. Irrigation district policies and capa-\nbilities often dictate when and for how long an irriga-\ntor will get water; i.e., delivery schedule. Cultural\noperations, such as hay cutting, over-canopy pesticide\napplication, or row crop cultivation, have a major\nimpact on scheduling. Some farmers do not like to\nkeep written records; however, most have accepted\nthe fact that they must for other purposes. Many\nfarmers have a personal computer system. Some\nprefer to hire management services to give them\ninformation needed.\nAll these factors must be taken into account when\ndetermining what irrigation scheduling procedure will\nbe best suited to a water user. A good rule to follow,\nkeep it simple and easy to understand, even when\na computer system is used. Adaptation requires main-\ntaining the risk perceived equal to or less than the\ncurrent way irrigation water is being scheduled.\n(b) Irrigation scheduling methods\nIrrigations can be scheduled using methods varying\nfrom simple soil water monitoring using the feel and\nappearance method to sophisticated computer as-\nsisted programs that predict plant growth. Scheduling\ninvolves continual updating of field information and\nforecasting future irrigation dates and amounts.\nCrop yield and quality can be improved with most\nplants by maintaining lower soil-water tensions\n(higher moisture levels). Thus, it is wise to irrigate\nwhen the soil profile can hold a full irrigation. Waiting\nuntil a predetermined percent of soil AWC is used can\ncause unnecessary stress.\n(1) Soil and crop monitoring methods\nSome scheduling practices are based solely on moni-\ntoring soil-water content or crop water use. Irrigations\nare needed when the soil-water content or crop water\nuse reaches predetermined critical levels. Soil-water\ncontent and plant moisture tension measuring devices\nand procedures are described in section 652.0902(b).\nUsing the monitoring data is briefly described in this\nsection.\nAccurate monitoring should provide the irrigation\ndecisionmaker information at or soon after the time of\nmeasurement. The data must be available to ensure\nthat the field can be irrigated before moisture stress\noccurs. Monitored data must be displayed so that the\ninformation is easy to understand and use to predict\nan irrigation date. When past data are projected for-\nward, usually the future will resemble the past. Rap-\nidly growing crops and weather changes must be\nconsidered. Local weather forecasts can provide a\nguide as to when to irrigate, but frequent field mea-\nsurements are often necessary.",

Crop water use can be measured, but it\nis usually calculated or estimated. The Crop Water\nStress Index (CWSI) method measures plant condition\nand compares that status to a known reference for a\nwell watered plant condition. Infrared photography\nindicates presence or lack of surface moisture, either\non soil surface or plant leaf surface. Some skill is\nnecessary to interpret color intensity on infrared\nphotographs. What appears to be plant moisture stress\nmay result from other causes, such as insect damage,\nlack of key nutrients, or from other toxic materials on\nleaf surfaces. Number of sets, days, and rotation or\ncycle time to get across a field should be considered\nwhen using a field monitoring method.\nSome level of soil and crop monitoring is essential for\nefficient irrigation water management. Growing high\nvalue crops can support a sophisticated monitoring\nand scheduling program whether it be for optimizing\nwater use and crop yield, maintaining desirable crop\nquality, minimizing use of fertilizer, or educing runoff,\ndeep percolation, or both. Monitoring can be accurate\nwhere irrigators are adequately trained and personally\ninterested. The monitoring schedule should fit into the\npattern of irrigation. Monitoring dates before and after\nan irrigation should be flexible and adjustable to\nprovide better management information.\n(ii) Soil moisture monitoring—Monitoring soil-\nwater content before, during, and after the crop grow-\ning season is the primary tool to schedule irrigations\nor calibrate other less labor intensive irrigation sched-\nuling tools.\nSoil moisture monitoring is perhaps the most accurate\nirrigation scheduling tool. With experience the feel and\nappearance method can be used to accurately deter-\nmine soil moisture available for crop use. If other\nmethods are used to determine soil moisture, the feel\nand appearance method should also be used to check\nthe other method and to experience the fingers in\ndetermining soil moisture. At first three to five\nsamples are examined at four or five sample sites in a\nfield. Again with experience and a specific crop and\nsoil, one soil sample at a depth of 12 to 18 inches can\nbe sufficient per sample site. At this depth soil samples\ncan be removed with a soil probe or small auger,\ntypically under the growing plant. Displaying moisture\ncontent at various depths may be desirable at each\nmonitoring site. Too little or too much soil moisture in\nthe profile becomes more apparent when displayed\ngraphically.\nSoil moisture monitoring is used to calibrate or affirm\nother irrigation scheduling methods that predict plant\nwater use by measuring plant stress (crop water stress\nindex, plant tissue monitoring) or calculate plant\nwater use based upon climatic data. Examples are\nNRCS (SCS) SCHEDULER computer software or\ncheckbook method. With these other methods, check-\ning actual soil moisture is like receiving your bank\nstatement from the bank. It affirms or cautions you\nwhen an error may exist or other adjustments are\nneeded. See Section 652.0902(b), Measuring soil-water\ncontent.\nMany computer scheduling programs use soil moisture\nmeasurements for updating methods based on com-\nputing the soil-water balance. Figure 9–8 provides a\nschematic of a basic soil-water content monitoring\ndisplay to schedule irrigations. The same principal can\nbe used regardless of units provided by a soil-water\ncontent or plant moisture tension level measuring\ndevice. Displaying may be desirable the various\ndepths, if applicable, at each monitoring site.\nFigure 9–8 \tSoil-water measurements used to predict day\nto irrigate\nMeasured soil-\nwater content\nin soil profile\nForecast\nToday\nTime\nHigh\nET\nAvg.\nET\nLow\nET\nPrevious soil\nwater check\nSoil-water content\nAllowable\ndepletion",

In this case,\ninstead of a bank holding the money, the soil profile\nholds water available for plant growth in the root zone.\nIf the amount of available water (bank balance) in the\nroot zone at the end of day one is known and if the\nwater losses (withdrawals) and gains (deposits) that\noccurred on day two are known or can be estimated,\nthen the amount of soil water in the root zone at the\nend of day two can be calculated.\nDeposits of water to the plant root zone are effective\nprecipitation, irrigation, or water table contribution.\nWithdrawal of water from the root zone is primarily\ncrop evapotranspiration (ET c) and soil evaporation.\nManual, adding machine, hand calculator, or computer\nbookkeeping methods can be used. Checkbook crop\nuse data can be forecasted crop ET, pan evaporation,\nor other data. Because of spatial variability, rainfall\namounts should be measured at the field. Net irriga-\ntion or precipitation application amounts can be\nreasonably estimated. Soil-water content measure-\nments should be made to calibrate calculations and\nother measurements.\nDeep percolation cannot be directly measured in a\nfield situation, but is accounted for in field application\nefficiency, which also includes improper irrigation\ntiming (too much water too late). Irrigation depths\napplied under sprinkler systems can be measured by\nusing catch cans (rain gauges) to determine applica-\ntion amounts, flow measuring devices to measure\nirrigation flows to laterals or from sprinkler heads, and\nestimates of evaporation losses. A water balance\nmethod, such as the checkbook method, is used by the\nirrigator to track crop water use and soil-water deficit.\nCrop evapotranspiration reporting services are some-\ntimes available. This community wide, private, or\npublic service calculates daily crop evapotranspiration\nfor selected crops and provides this information to\nirrigators through radio, newspaper, television, or by a\nspecial telephone service. The TV Weather Channel\ndisplays maps showing ET of well-watered grass for\nthe preceding week.\nThe Water Balance Irrigation Scheduling Worksheet\n(fig. 9–9) may be used with the checkbook method.\n(3) Computer assisted methods\nComputerized irrigation scheduling allows the storage\nand transfer of data, easy access to data, and calcula-\ntions using the most advanced and complex methods\nfor predicting crop ET. Many computer software\nprograms are available to assist in scheduling irriga-\ntions. Most programs access data bases for soil char-\nacteristics, crop growth characteristics, climate, water\nsupply, irrigation system, and economic data. The\nability to directly access and process climate data\nfrom a regional network of local stations or an onsite\nweather station has greatly streamlined data entry and\nanalysis for computerized scheduling. Scheduling\nprograms are no better than the data used or the\nability of the irrigator to interpret output data.\n(i) \tDaily crop evapotranspiration—ET c is\ncomputed to the day of real-time climate data avail-\nability, then the method predicts crop ET for up to 10\ndays in the future. The data can be used by the irriga-\ntor to keep a water balance worksheet (fig. 9–9) for\neach field. This type program generally is used by a\nlocal agency or district, consultant, water company, or\nwater district to provide information to local irriga-\ntors. Crop ET data are often available to the irrigation\ndecisionmaker in local newspapers, telephone dial-up\nservice, or television. Irrigation decisionmakers for\nlarge farms or farms growing high value crops often\nuse onfarm weather station(s) and the farm computer\nto calculate daily plant water use. However, almost\nany size farm can support the use of a computer. The\ncomputer facilitates the management of all natural\nresource data as well as record keeping on the farm.\nThe method is similar to the checkbook method.\n(ii) Local real-time climate data—Climate data\nare retrieved by computer phone modem, soils data\nand crop growth characteristics are accessed, current\ncrop ET is computed, monitored soil-water content is\ninput if available, and a complete crop-soil water\nbalance set of records is developed by computer\nsoftware for each field being scheduled. Actual onsite,\nfield by field, irrigation system performance is used as\nbasis to determine net irrigation application values.\nThis type program is used directly by the irrigator\n(or farm consultant) using their own computer and\ntelephone modem.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–28 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nA good irrigation scheduling program can be updated\non a regular basis with soil-water content data to\nimprove efficiency and accuracy of determining when\nto irrigate and how much water to apply. Following\nperiods of excess rainfall when soils are probably at or\nnear field capacity is an easy calibration point. Calcu-\nlated available soil water should be near field capacity.\nWhen crop ET and water costs versus crop yield data\nare known, a true current economic evaluation can be\npresented to the irrigation decisionmaker. Improved\npredictions from computerized irrigation scheduling\nallow the irrigation decisionmaker to lengthen the\nperiod between field monitoring and reduce the uncer-\ntainty of the soil-water balance. Adequate and timely\nwater can be provided to the crop and deep percola-\ntion losses minimized when following a good irrigation\nscheduling program.\nSome currently available computer programs are\nbriefly described in the following paragraphs. Docu-\nmentation required to run the program must be avail-\nable and easy to understand.\nNRCS (SCS) Scheduler (DOS Version 3.0 as of 6/96)\n—This irrigation scheduling program was developed\nfor NRCS by Michigan State University. It is usable\nnationwide and is applicable in most climates. Using\nonfarm characteristics and local real time climate\ndata, a simple accounting process is employed to:\n• Determine daily and monthly evapotranspiration\nof the crop.\n• Determine seasonal irrigation requirement.\n• Account for change in soil-water content since it\nwas last measured.\n• Predict rate at which soil water will decrease\nover the next 10 days.\nThis program works with any soil and may be applied\nto any number of crops as crop-specific growth data\nbecome available. Currently the program includes 42\ncrop curves. Climatic data and crop information neces-\nsary for local irrigation scheduling should be devel-\noped or adapted from local information. Accounting\nfor onsite rainfall is essential. Climate data may be\nentered manually or transferred directly from a local\nreal-time climatic data collection station via phone\nmodem. To update the soil-water balance, soil-water\ncontent monitoring data can be input at anytime.\nFigures 9–10 and 9–11 display seasonal crop ET curves\nand soil-water content status using NRCS (SCS)\nSCHEDULER computer program.\nUS Bureau of Reclamation Scheduling program\n(Agrimet)—Bureau of Reclamation has adopted and\nmodified a computer scheduling program developed at\nUSDA Agriculture Research Station at Kimberly,\nIdaho. Agrimet is the Northwest Cooperative Agricul-\ntural Weather Network. It is cooperatively sponsored\nby land grant universities, Cooperative Extension\nService, NRCS, local soil and water conservation\ndistricts, ARS, local irrigation districts, and other state\nand local water resource agencies and organizations.\nSensors collect real time climate data (air tempera-\nture, relative humidity, solar radiation, precipitation,\nand wind run speed and direction). A data collection\nplatform (DCP) interrogates the sensors at pro-\ngrammed intervals, every 15 minutes or hourly, de-\npending on the parameter. The DCP transmits the data\nevery 4 hours via the GOES satellite to a central re-\nceive site in Boise, Idaho. The recorded parameters\nare used to calculate a daily reference ET based on the\n1982 Kimberly-Penman equation. Crop water use\nmodels are run daily to translate the local climatic\ndata into daily ET information for crops at each\nweather station. Anyone with a computer, a modem,\nand an Agrimet user name can access Agrimet for\nweather data or site-specific daily crop water use\ninformation from throughout the Pacific Northwest\nRegion. Other onfarm factors to considered when\nusing the published crop ET data include water used\nfor environmental control, salinity control, and irriga-\ntion system application efficiency and uniformity.\nARS personnel at Ft. Collins, Colorado, developed a\ncomputer assisted irrigation scheduling program.\nProgram software uses minimum to optimum field\ndata to predict when to irrigate. Default values replace\nmeasured data where necessary. In general, the better\nthe field data input, the more precise the data output.\nUniversity scheduling programs—Several computer\nscheduling programs are available and supported by\nmany local universities. Typically, these programs\napply statewide or to more localized areas within a\nstate. The State Supplement section at the end of this\nchapter gives additional information on programs\navailable from local universities.",

The results of these\nobservations and evaluations are used to help them\nimprove water management techniques, upgrade their\nirrigation system(s), or both. Improvements to opera-\ntions and management can conserve water; reduce\nlabor, energy, and nutrient losses; generally improve\ncrop yields, biomass, and product quality; and reduce\nexisting or potential water pollution. The following\nprinciples apply to all irrigation methods and systems.\n• Irrigation should be completed in a timely man-\nner to maintain a favorable soil-water content for\ndesired crop growth. An exception may be made\nwhere the water supply is limited. In this situa-\ntion, water should be applied in a manner that\nmaximizes water use benefits.\n• The amount of water applied should be sufficient\nto bring the crop root zone to field capacity\nminus allowable storage for potential rainfall\nevents.\n• Water should be applied at a rate that will not\ncause waste, erosion, or contamination of\nground water and downstream surface water.\n• Improving management of the existing system is\nalways the first increment of change for im-\nproved water management. Each irrigation\nevaluation should consider a change in water\nmanagement decisions only, and then a change\nin water management decisions and irrigation\nsystem performance.\nEvaluation is the analysis of any irrigation system and\nmanagement based on measurements taken in the\nfield under conditions and practices normally used. An\nexamination of irrigation water management practices\nshould attempt to answer the following questions:\n• Is the water supply sufficient (quantity and\nquality) and is it reliable enough to meet the\nproducers objective?\n• Are irrigations being applied in a timely manner?",

How does this affect\nuniformity of application?\n(b) Irrigation efficiency defini-\ntions\nIrrigation efficiencies are a measure of how well an\nirrigation system works as well as the level of manage-\nment of the system. The definitions that follow are\nsimilar to standard definitions developed by ASAE and\nASCE, and are used in NRCS.\n(1) Conveyance efficiency\nConveyance efficiency (Ec) is the ratio of water deliv-\nered to the total water diverted or pumped into an\nopen channel or pipeline at the upstream end, ex-\npressed as a percentage. It includes seepage losses,\nevaporation, and leakage inherent in the specific\nconveyance facility. With appropriate identification it\ncould also include operational spills.\n(2) Irrigation efficiency\nIrrigation efficiency (E i ) is the ratio of the average\ndepth of irrigation water beneficially used to the\naverage depth applied, expressed as a percentage.\n(3) Application efficiency\nApplication efficiency (E a) is the ratio of the average\ndepth of irrigation water infiltrated and stored in the\nplant root zone to the average depth of irrigation water\napplied, expressed as a percentage. Average depth\nstored in root zone (or intercepted by plants) cannot\nexceed soil-water deficit (SWD), but may be equal. If\nthe entire root zone will be filled to field capacity\nduring an irrigation, then average depth infiltrated and\nstored in the root zone is SWD.\n(4) Application efficiency low quarter\nApplication efficiency low quarter (AELQ or E q) is the\nratio of the average of the lowest one-fourth of mea-\nsurements of irrigation water infiltrated and stored in\nthe plant root zone to the average depth of irrigation\napplied; it is expressed as a percentage.\n(5) Application efficiency low half\nApplication efficiency low half (AELH or E h) is the\nratio of the average of the low one-half of measure-\nments of irrigation water infiltrated and stored in the\nplant root zone to the average depth of irrigation water\napplied; it is expressed as a percentage.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–32 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\n(6) Project application efficiency\nProject application efficiency (E p ) is the ratio of the\naverage depth of irrigation water infiltrated and stored\nin the plant root zone to the average depth of irrigation\nwater diverted or pumped; it is expressed as a percent-\nage. Project application efficiency includes the com-\nbined efficiencies from conveyance and application. It\ncan be the overall efficiency of only onfarm facilities,\nor for community projects, it may include both on and\noff-farm efficiencies.\n(7) Potential or design application efficien-\ncies\nPotential or design application efficiencies are usually\nthose recommended in the irrigation guide and in\nvarious tables and charts in NEH, Part 623 (Section\n15), Irrigation. These efficiencies are typically used for\ndesigning irrigation systems. The efficiency recom-\nmendations usually assume good management and\nmaintenance of a well designed and installed system.\nIf it is anticipated that a specific irrigator will not meet\nthese criteria, then a lower potential application effi-\nciency should be used than those recommended in\nreferences. Judgment by the designer is required.\nOverestimating the operator’s level of management\ncan result in an inadequate irrigation system design.\n(8) Uniformity of application\nHow uniform an irrigation system applies water across\nthe field is important. Within a range of physical condi-\ntions and management, any irrigation method can\napply water in such a manner that over 90 percent of\napplied water is used by the plant. However, the range\nof physical conditions (topography, soils, water sup-\nply) in which this level of uniformity and management\ncan be accomplished, can be narrow. Selection of a\ndifferent irrigation method and system may provide a\nwider, more reasonable range of conditions; thus\nfewer management limitations.\n(9) Distribution uniformity\nDistribution uniformity (DU) is a measure of the\nuniformity of infiltrated irrigation water distribution\nover a field. DU is defined as the ratio of the lowest\none-fourth of measurements of irrigation water infil-\ntrated to the average depth of irrigation water infil-\ntrated, expressed as a percentage. For low value\ncrops, maintenance of vegetation, or areas of partial\nseason irrigation, DU of low one-half may be more\neconomical than using low one-quarter.\nSprinkler systems:\nDU = \t×\nAverage low - quarter depth received\nAverage catch can depth received 100\nSurface systems:\nDU = Average low - quarter depth infiltrated\nAverage depth infiltrated × 100\nThe average low-quarter depth of water received is the\naverage of the lowest one-quarter of the measured\nvalues where each value represents an equal area. For\ncalculation of DU of low one-half, substitute average\nlow half depth received or infiltrated in place of low\nquarter.\n(10) Christiansen’s uniformity\nChristiansen’s uniformity (CU) is another parameter\nthat has been used to evaluate uniformity for sprinkle\nand micro irrigation systems. DU should be used\ninstead of CU. Thus, sprinkler and micro irrigation\napplication uniformity can be directly compared to\nother irrigation methods and systems.

These procedures are\nused for a simple, abbreviated, or detailed evaluation\nand are the first step in any system evaluation.\nFor any irrigation method or system, equipment\nneeded to check soil moisture and compacted layers is\na soil auger, push tube sampler, or soil probe. If the\nsoil is rocky, a shovel (sharp shooter) is also needed\nA pressure gauge with pitot tube attachment, drill bits\nto check nozzle wear, short piece of hose, and cali-\nbrated container to check nozzle discharge are needed\nfor sprinkler irrigation systems. For micro irrigation\nsystems, special fittings for pressure gauge and catch\ncontainers to check the head and emitter discharge are\nneeded. Surface irrigation systems require measuring\ndevices to check furrow and border inflow and out-\nflow. Flow measuring devices are needed for sub-\nirrigation systems.\n(2) Evaluation procedures\nStep 1—Determine basic data about the irrigation\nsystem and management from the irrigation\ndecisionmaker. Some questions that might be asked\ninclude:\n• How does the irrigation decisionmaker deter-\nmine when to irrigate and how much water to\napply?\n• How is length of time for each irrigation set\ndetermined?\n• For sprinkler and micro irrigation systems, what\nare the operating pressures at several locations\nalong a selected lateral?\n• How is the time to shut water off determined?\n• How long does it take for water to reach the end\nof borders or furrows?\n• What is the irrigation water supply flow rate in\nearly season? mid season? late season?\n• How is flow rate determined?\n• What is the rate of flow onto each border or into\na furrow? into the system?\n• What problems (or concerns) have the irrigator\nexperienced with the system?\n• Are there dry spots in the field? wet spots? Are\nlarge areas of the field under irrigated?\noverirrigated?\n• Crop production:\n— \tWhat is the average production of each field\nirrigated?\n— \tDoes it meet or exceed county or area aver-\nages?\n— \tDoes production vary across the field? If so,\nwhat does the irrigation decisionmaker feel\nare the causes (irrigation system, field sur-\nface nonuniformity, water supply amount\nand location of source or delivery, soil,\nfertilizer, chemigation, pests)?\n• How much control does the irrigator have over\nwhen and how much irrigation water is avail-\nable? delivery schedule?\n• What are farm manager’s objectives?\n• What is the skill level, timing, and amount of\nlabor available?\n• Can water be changed at night? during the\nmiddle of the day? at odd hours? If short set\ntimes are necessary, is a semiautomatic or com-\nplete automatic control system available?\nStep 2—Observe the field in question. Look at other\nfields. Look at the supply system. Look for and ask:\n• Are there erosion or sediment deposition areas?\n• Are there indications of excessive runoff from\npart or all of the field?\n• Are there problems (benefits) created by exces-\nsive irrigation tailwater or field runoff?\n• Do leaky ditches and pipelines appear to have\nexcessive water loss (seeps or leaks)? (1gpm=1\nacre inch every 20 days)\n• Are crops uneven or discolored? Do they show\nobvious stress?\n• Are there water loving plants and weeds present?\nIf so, is there an obvious wildlife benefit?\n• Are there saline or swampy areas?\n• Are there obvious signs of poorly maintained\nmicro and sprinkler hardware, including leaky\ngaskets, weak or broken springs, plugged emit-\nters, or worn nozzles?\n• Are there poorly maintained diversion or turnout\ngates, leaks, uneven flows from siphon tubes or\ngated pipe gates, uneven irrigation heads, weeds,\nand trash?\n• Are there measuring devices? Are they in satis-\nfactory operating condition? Are they used to\nmake onfield water management decisions?",

The feel and appearance\nmethod of moisture determination can also be demon-\nstrated. Look for such information as:\n• Is there evidence of an excessive high water\ntable or indications of a fluctuating water table?\n• Locate hard pans, compacted layers, mineral\nlayers, or other characteristics that can restrict\nroot growth and the movement of water in the\nsoil. What is the apparent cause(s) of each re-\nstriction?\n• Does soil texture change at various levels in the\nsoil profile?\n• Observe water content of each soil layer. Demon-\nstrate the feel and appearance method of mois-\nture determination to the irrigation\ndecisionmaker. Is the location of wetted soil\nshallow (typically under irrigated) or deep (typi-\ncally overirrigated) in the soil profile?\n• Are root development patterns normal (unre-\nstricted by soil compaction, overirrigation) for\nthe time of year and stage of crop growth?\n• Is soil condition favorable for plant growth?\nStep 4—Discuss with the irrigation decisionmaker the\nfindings and information so far obtained. Listen for\nmanagement reasons. Make recommendations if\nenough information is available to do so. Make sure\nthere is a true communication with the farm manager\nor irrigator. Use sketches and narratives, if appropri-\nate. Are decisions based on tradition or field observa-\ntions and measurements?\n(d) Simplified irrigation system\nand water management evalua-\ntions\nSome simple evaluation items can be done by irriga-\ntion system operators that will help them make man-\nagement and operation of irrigation equipment deci-\nsions. They include:\nItem 1—For sprinkler and micro irrigation system,\nthey can check:\n• Operating pressures at pump, mainline, sprinkler\nheads, upstream and downstream of filters to\nassure they match design.\n• Application depth for the irrigation set by using a\nfew 3- to 4-inch random placed, straight sided,\nvegetable or fruit tin containers for catch con-\ntainers. Measure water depth in catch containers\nwith a pocket tape. Does it match design and\nwhat is desired?\n• Discharge from a few microsystem emitters\nusing a one-quart container and a watch. Do not\nraise emitter more than a few inches. Compute\nflow in gallons per hour. Do flows match design?\n• Translocation and runoff from sprinkler systems.\nItem 2—For all irrigation systems, simplified field\nchecking by the operator can include calculation of\ndepth of irrigation for a set using the basic equation,\nQT = DA.\nwhere:\nQ = flow rate (ft3/s)\nT = time of irrigation application (hr)\nD = gross depth of water applied (in)\nA = area irrigated (acres)\nItem 3—Using a probe, shovel, soils auger, or push\ntype core sampler, the operator can put down a few\nholes after an irrigation to determine depth of water\npenetration. Does it match plant rooting depths?\nDepending on the irrigation system and soil, checking\non water penetration could be anywhere from an hour\nafter the irrigation to the next day.\nItem 4—Check runoff. Is it excessive? Does it contain\nsediment?",

Such an evaluation\nshould always precede a more detailed evaluation.\nWith some guidance the irrigation decisionmaker can\nperform abbreviated irrigation evaluations themselves.\nAbbreviated management and irrigation system evalu-\nations can be made by onfarm managers or NRCS field\nstaff. Many times, needed changes can be identified in\nless than an hour.\n(1) Sprinkle irrigation\nBefore irrigation, randomly place calibrated catch\ncontainers (or rain gauges) at plant canopy height.\nContainers should be straight sided with a reasonably\nsharp edge. When irrigation is complete, a pocket tape\nor graduated cylinder may be used to measure depth\nof water caught in each container. This provides an\nindication of average depth of application only. When\nsufficient number of containers is used with a uniform\nspacing pattern within all of the sprinkler lateral\napplication area, pattern uniformity can be calculated\n(see section 3 in this section).\n(2) Sprinkle irrigation (center pivot or linear\nmove)\nUsing the design nozzle package, source pressure, and\nlateral size provided by the owner or dealer, a com-\nputer evaluation can be made in a few minutes if the\ncomputer program is readily available. Field observa-\ntion of an operating system can identify improper\n(usually plugged or wrong nozzle size) nozzle opera-\ntion. A computer equipment evaluation or field inspec-\ntion of irrigation equipment in use (including lateral\npressures and nozzles used) should always precede a\ndetailed system evaluation.\n(3) Sprinkle, surface, and micro irrigation\nA portable or permanently installed flow measuring\ndevice can be used to evaluate gross irrigation water\napplied. By knowing the flow rate and kilowatt hours\nper hour energy used with electric powered pumps,\nthe volume of water pumped can be determined using\nthe common electric meter. When using gas or diesel,\nhours of operation can be determined by knowing the\ncubic feet, pounds, or gallons of fuel used and the rate\nof fuel used per hour. Totalizing time clocks that\noperate from the engine ignition can also be used.\nIrrigators try all too often to cover more acres than the\nwater supply will adequately provide, or they\noverirrigate a large part of the field to satisfy a small\narea. Applying the formula QT = DA will solve four out\nof five IWM problems. Net irrigation depth can be\ncalculated by multiplying gross depth by the overall\nirrigation efficiency expressed as a decimal.\nSome irrigators estimate plant water need accurately\nthen fail to measure flow onto the field, thus applying\nan unknown quantity of water. Flow measuring de-\nvices are one of the most valuable water management\ntools available to the irrigator. Accurate devices for\npipelines and open channels may cost as little as $50\nto over $1,000. Where water supply is not limited,\nfarmers typically apply too much water, especially\nwhere plant water needs or water applied are not\nmeasured. This is also common with an irrigation\ndelivery system where water is delivered on a rotation\nbasis.\n(4) Surface and sprinkle irrigation\nThe ball or tile probe is perhaps the most versatile and\ncheapest tool available to the irrigation\ndecisionmaker. Following irrigation, the probe can be\ninserted in the soil at various points along the length of\nrun (surface irrigation) or across the field (sprinkle\nirrigation) to measure the depth of water penetration.\n(Penetration is easy where water lubricates the soil.)\nBy knowing the soil AWC, the effective irrigation\nwater applied is calculated. Both management applica-\ntion efficiency and system distribution uniformity can\nbe calculated. The ball or tile probe works best where\nthere is an abrupt boundary between a wetted soil and\na soil with moisture at less than field capacity. In\nrocky soil, a sound is emitted when the probe strikes a\nrock, otherwise no sound should be heard.\nThe ball or tile probe can also be used to detect excess\nmoisture in lower portions of the soil profile even\nthough soil at or near the surface appears dry, thus\ndelaying irrigation and improving plant vigor.",

With experience the irrigation decision-\nmaker can schedule irrigation applications based upon\nsoil moisture at a relatively shallow depth. Application\nefficiency (E a) and irrigation system distribution\nuniformity (DU) can be calculated using soil auger or\nprobe observations. An advantage in using the ball\nprobe, soil probe, or soil auger is that you observe\nother field crop conditions when walking through the\nfield, thus use the multiresource planning process.\nMany locations in the field can be quickly checked.\n(f) Water management and irriga-\ntion system evaluations\n(1) Graded or level border (basin)\n(i) \tEquipment—Equipment needed for a graded or\nlevel border includes:\n• Soil auger, probe, push type core sampler.\n• Watch, 100-foot tape.\n• Lath or wire flags for marking stations.\n• Portable water measuring device, such as sharp\ncrested weir, Replogle flume, Parshall flume,\nbroadcrested weir, and pipe flow meter. Capacity\nneeded depends on typical inflows used in the\narea.\n(ii) Procedures—The following procedures should\nbe followed.\nBefore start of irrigation:\n• Estimate the soil-water deficit (SWD) at several\nlocations down the border being investigated.\nUse feel and appearance method.\n• Set flags or stakes at uniform distances down the\nborder (generally 100-foot spacing).\nDuring irrigation:\n• Observe how uniformly water spreads across the\nborder (basin) width. The soil surface should not\nhave excessively high or low spots, and no inter-\nmittent ponding should occur.\n• Observe and record the time when the water\nreaches each station. These times will be used\nlater in plotting a simple advance rate curve.\n• Record the time and location of the water front\nwhen inflow is turned off.\n• Record the time when 90 percent of the soil\nsurface area is no longer covered by water at\neach station. These times will be used later in\nplotting a recession curve. No long time ponding\nshould occur.\n• Measure or estimate the volume of runoff in\nterms of percent of inflow volume. (Duration of\nrunoff is determined from the records mentioned\nabove.)\n• Probe approximately 24 hours following irriga-\ntion, the soil profile down the border strip to\ncheck uniformity of water penetration. Where\nsoil and crops are uniform, a previously irrigated\nborder strip may be used for this purpose.\n• Determine adequacy of the irrigation with an\nadditional simple check if the rate of inflow is\nknown or can be estimated. Use the basic equa-\ntion QT = DA to calculate the gross depth of\nirrigation application from the known rate of\ninflow, duration of irrigation, and length and\nwidth of border strip. An example to determine\ngross application depth, D, for a border strip 100\nfeet wide and 1,200 feet long, with 3 cubic feet\nper second inflow for a set inflow time of 4.5\nhours, would be:\nD Q\nD ft \ts \thr\nA in\n= ×\t( \t)\n= ( \t) × ( \t) =\nT\nA\n3 0 \t4 5 4 9\n3\n\t. \t/ \t. . \t.\nwhere:\nA = ( \t) × ( \t) =\n100 \t1 200\n43 560 2 75\t2\nft \tft\nft \tacre acres\n,\n, \t/ .\nWhen the gross depth of application, D = 4.9 inches, is\nmultiplied by the estimated overall application effi-\nciency (decimal), average net depth of irrigation can\nbe estimated. The field technician needs to have\nexperience in ranges of average application efficien-\ncies for the farm or in the general area.\nAve. net depth = 4.9 x 60% = 3 inches (approx.)",

Show the time when\nwater was shutoff and location of water front at that\ntime. The opportunity time is the time water was in\ncontact with the soil surface (the interval between the\nadvance and recession curves) at any given point\n(station) along the border. With basins, the water front\nat various times is plotted on an area basis, similar to\ntopographic contour lines. Advance and recession\ncurves can be plotted at select locations radiating\naway from the water supply onto the field.\nStep 2—Compare probe depths at various locations\ndown the border (basin) keeping in mind that water\nmovement through the soil may not be complete. Does\nit appear that parts of the border (basin) have had too\nshort an opportunity time?\nStep 3—If information on accumulated intake versus\ntime (intake characteristic [family] curve) for the\nparticular soil is available, compare actual opportunity\ntimes throughout the length of the border to the op-\nportunity time required for the net application as\ninterpolated from intake characteristic curves.\nStep 4—Large variations in opportunity times along\nthe length of the border indicate changes need to be\nmade in the rate of flow, duration of flow, or field\nsurface conditions. Large variations between the\nopportunity time determined from the intake charac-\nteristic (family) curve and the actual opportunity times\nindicate that changes need to be made in the applica-\ntion or that the estimated intake characteristic (fam-\nily) curve number is wrong. If it appears that the\nintake characteristic (family) curve number used is\nwrong, then a complete system analysis, including ring\ninfiltrometer tests, may be required if more detailed\nrecommendations are desirable.\nStep 5—If possible, check the original design. Is the\nsystem being operated in accordance with the design\n(hours of each set, return frequency)? Should redesign\nbe considered?\nStep 6—Are irrigation water screening facilities\nneeded?\nStep 7—Are there water, soil, or plant management\nchanges that can be made to reduce beneficial water\nuse, fertilizer use, or water lost?\n(2) Graded or level furrows\n(i) \tEquipment—The equipment needed includes:\n• Soil auger, probe, push type core sampler,\nshovel.\n• Portable flow measuring devices (broadcrested\nweir/flume, Replogle flume, Parshall flume, v-\nnotch flume, v-notch sharpcrested weir, orifice\nflow plate, siphon tubes, flow meter in a short\nlength of pipe, bucket).\n• Watch with second hand or stop watch.\n• Stakes or wire flags for locating stations.\nAt least three furrows should be evaluated. Included\nshould be the correct proportion of wheel rows,\nnonwheel rows, and guess rows. A judgment decision\nmust be whether these few furrows adequately repre-\nsent the entire field.\n(ii) Procedures—The following procedures should\nbe followed.\nBefore the start of irrigation:\n• Estimate the soil-water deficit (SWD) at several\nlocations down furrows being investigated (use\nfeel and appearance method). Check soil mois-\nture in the root zone (not necessarily in the\ncenter of the furrow). Is it dry enough to irrigate?\n• Note the condition of furrows. Has there been a\ncultivation since the last irrigation?\n• Set stakes or wire flags at 100-foot stations down\nthe length of each furrow evaluated.\nFigure 9–12 \tPlot of example advance and recession\ncurves\n0 \t1 \t2 \t3 \t4 \t7 \t8 \t9 \t10\t6\t5\nStation (100's ft)\nIntake\nopportunity\ntime\nElapsed\ntime\n(min or hr) Advance\ncurve\nRecession\ncurve",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–38 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nDuring an irrigation:\n• Measure (or estimate) the inflow rate (example\n9–1). If siphon tubes are used, a siphon tube\nhead-discharge chart can be used to estimate\ninflow. If total inflow is known, divide total\ninflow by the number of furrows being irrigated.\nTiming furrow flow catch in a bucket of known\ncapacity or using a portable furrow flow measur-\ning device are both accurate.\n• Observe the time it takes water to reach each\nstation (lath or wire flag) and to reach the lower\nend of each furrow evaluated.\n• Measure furrow outflow with a portable flow\nmeasuring device periodically during the runoff\nphase to get an average outflow rate in gallons\nper minute, or estimate runoff rate in terms of\npercent of inflow rate (example 9–1).\n• Check for erosion and sedimentation in the\nfurrow or tailwater collection facilities.\n• Dig a trench across a furrow (plant stem to plant\nstem) to be irrigated by the next set. The wetted\nbulb can also be observed following an irrigation.\nObserve conditions, such as:\n— \tActual root development, location, and\npattern\n— \tCompaction layers—identify cause (cultiva-\ntion, wheel type equipment, plowing,\ndisking)\n— \tSoil textural changes\n— \tSalt accumulation and location\n• About 24 hours following irrigation, probe the\nlength of a representative furrow to check unifor-\nmity of water penetration. Where soil and crops\nare uniform, a previously irrigated furrow set can\nbe used for this purpose.\n(iii) Use of field data—The following steps should\nbe used with the field data:\nStep 1—Was the soil dry enough to start irrigating?\nWhat was the soil-water deficit in the root zone at\nvarious points along the furrow before irrigating?\nStep 2—Did water penetrate uniformly along the\nlength of furrow? Good uniformity usually is achieved\nif the stream progresses uniformly and reaches the\nlower end of the furrow without erosion in about a\nquarter to a third of the total inflow time. Should\nfurrow length be reduced? increased? Should inflow\nrate be changed?\nPlot the advance curve for the furrow (see fig. 9–12).\nPlotting of the furrow advance curve is basically the\nsame as the plot of the border advance curve. Shape of\nadvance curve can indicate adequacy of inflow rates in\nrelation to soil intake characteristics for that specific\nlength of furrow. Estimates for adjustments in furrow\nirrigation operation values can be made using inflow\nand advance rate estimates.\nStep 3—Was there runoff? How much? Water ponding\nwith blocked end nearly level furrows or running off at\nthe lower end of nonblocked furrows is essential for\npractical operation and a full, uniform irrigation.\nRunoff water can be collected and reused by using a\ntailwater collection and return-flow facility.\nStep 4—Are the water supply and conveyance systems\ncapable of delivering enough water for efficient and\nconvenient use of both water and labor? Supplies\nshould be large enough and flexible in both rate and\nduration. Furrow streams should be adjustable to the\ndegree that flow will reach the end of most furrows in\nabout a quarter to a third of the total inflow time. If\nappropriate, tailwater reuse, cablegation, cutback, or\nsurge irrigation techniques can significantly increase\ndistribution uniformity (see chapter 5).\n(iv) Observations—Did soil in the crop root zone\ncontain all of the irrigation water applied? Is there still\na soil-water deficit in the root zone or is deep percola-\ntion below the root zone occurring? A simple before\nand after soil-water content check can provide data to\nestimate amounts before and after irrigation. However,\nthis does not account for uniformity or nonuniformity\nin application depths throughout the length of the\nfurrow. By simple soil probing or push core sampling\nthroughout the length of the furrow the next day\nfollowing an irrigation (or on a previous set), depth of\nwater penetration along the furrow can be observed.\nWith some field experience, inflow rate and set time\nadjustments can be recommended to improve depth of\nwater penetration and uniformity of water penetration\nalong the furrow length. A detailed field evaluation is\nnecessary for fine tuning recommendations. Often\nthese measurements can be observed by the farm\nirrigation decisionmaker or irrigator. Until a field\ntechnician is experienced with furrow irrigation, a\ncomplete evaluation process with data should be used.",

Check several sprinkler heads on the lateral.\nCalculate nozzle flow rate in gallons per minute.\nCalculate the precipitation rate from manufacturer\ntables or charts, or use the IWM equation (96.3 is units\nconversion factor when using gallons per minute and\nsprinkler head spacing in feet):\nI q\nS \tS\tl \tm\n= ( \t) × ( )\n×\n96 3\t.\nand\nDepth of water applied \tH\t= \t×\tI\nwhere:\nI \t= precipitation (application) rate, in/hr\nq \t= nozzle flow, gpm\nH \t= set time, hr\nSl \t= spacing of heads along lateral, ft\nSm = lateral spacing along main, ft\nStep 4—Take pressure readings at several locations\nalong the lateral(s) using the pitot tube pressure\ngauge. If not in the critical position, measure eleva-\ntions and calculate pressure differences if the lateral\nwas moved to that location. Critical location is usually\ndetermined by elevation and distance from the main-\nline or pump. Pressure differences should not exceed\n20 percent between any two sprinkler heads on the\nsame lateral. This provides for less than 10 percent\ndifference in discharge between heads on the lateral.\nDesirable and design operating pressure should occur\nin the area that affects most sprinklers; i.e., about a\nthird the distance from upstream end, on uniform\ndiameter, level laterals. Excessive operating pressure\nproduces small droplets, or fogging, and irregular\nturning of sprinkler heads. Small droplets are subject\nto wind drift and result in increased application close\nto the sprinkler head. Too low of a pressure causes\nimproper jet breakup giving large droplet sizes. This\ntypically produces a doughnut-shaped spray pattern,\nwhich if not corrected, results in a similar plant\ngrowth pattern. Larger droplets are less affected by\nwind. Very little water is applied close to the sprinkler\nhead. Both conditions, excessive and too little pres-\nsure, result in poor distribution patterns.\nStep 5—Using the shank end of a new, same size twist\ndrill bit, check the orifice diameter of several sprinkler\nnozzles for appropriate size and wear. The twist drill\nshank should just fit into the orifice without wiggle.\nExcess wiggle indicates excessive wear (or too large\nnozzle diameter), which indicates nonuniform dis-\ncharge from nozzles and poor distribution pattern\nbetween heads. Nozzles are considered worn if the\nnext diameter bit fits into the orifice or the drill bit can",

Wear is\ntypically caused from abrasive sediment in the water.\nOften excessive wear creates an oblong opening and is\nreadily apparent.\nUtilization of field data—The following steps\nshould be used with field data:\nStep 1—Was the soil dry enough to start irrigating?\nWas it too dry? What was the soil-water deficit at\nvarious locations in the field ahead of the sprinkler?\nStep 2—Compare the SWD to application. How does\nthe crop look? Is there evidence of under irrigation,\nsalinity problems, overirrigation? Are there obvious\nsprinkler application pattern problems? dry spots? dry\nstrips? donut-shaped patterns?\nStep 3—Is there soil erosion, water translocation, or\nrunoff? Is it general or only at specific locations? This\nindicates whether the application rate is too great. A\nsolution may be to improve irrigation water or tillage\nmanagement rather than changing hardware.\nStep 4—Are sprinkler heads vertical and are self\nleveling risers on wheel lines operating properly? Are\nsprinkler heads rotating evenly and timely? (They\nshould rotate at 1 to 2 revolutions per minute.) Do\nsprinkler head type, nozzle size, and pressure match\nspacing on lateral and along mainline and design? If it\nis apparent that sprinkler heads along the wheel line\nare not plumb, installation of self leveling heads\nshould be recommended. Installing new, proper sized\nnozzles can be one of the most cost effective opera-\ntional inprovements.\nStep 5—If possible, check the original design. Is the\nsystem being operated in accordance with the design\n(pressure, hours of each set, return frequency)?\nShould redesign be considered?\nStep 6—Are gaskets in good condition with no exces-\nsive leaks? Are nozzles plugged or partly plugged? Are\nreturn springs broken? Is a screening system needed?\nIf the nozzles are oversize, of varying size, or worn,\nthey should be replaced. Replacement with new\nnozzles of uniform size generally is one of the most\ncost effective actions an irrigator can take.\n(ii) Continuous (self) move—This type sprinkler\nsystem includes center pivot, linear, or lateral move.\nEquipment—The equipment needed includes:\n• Soil auger, probe, small diameter (1 inch) push\ntype core sampler.\n• Calibrated catch containers or rain gauges.\n• Measuring tape (50 ft).\n• Pressure gauge with pitot tube attachment.\nSuggest using liquid filled pressure gauges for\nincreased durability, plus the indicator needle\ndoes not flutter when making a reading.\n• Electrical resistance meter (tick meter) to check\nfor stray voltage.\n• Stakes to set containers or rain gauges above\ncrop canopy.\nProcedures—The following procedures should be\nused in the evaluation.\nStep 1—Safety precautions should be followed before\ntouching or climbing upon an electric powered self\nmoving lateral system. Check for stray electric cur-\nrents with a properly grounded tick meter or other\napproved equipment or methods, then use the back of\nthe hand to briefly touch metal lateral components the\nfirst time. Don’t grab any part of the system until it is\nchecked. Muscles in the hand and fingers contract\nwhen subjected to electrical currents, causing the\nfingers to close and stay closed. If portable ladders are\nused to reach any of the sprinkler heads, it is advisable\nto use ladders made from OSHA approved nonconduc-\ntive material. Hooks should be installed on the upper\nend of the ladder because the system moves during the\nevaluation.\nStep 2—Uniformly place catch containers or rain\ngauges at or slightly above the crop canopy equidistant\napart (the closer the spacing the more accurate the\nresults, generally not greater than 30 feet apart) and\nahead of the moving lateral so the lateral will cross\nperpendicular over them. For best accuracy, two rows\nof catch containers are set out and catch is averaged.\nHowever, one row is typically used to provide informa-\ntion needed to make general decisions. For center\npivot systems, select representative spans near the\nmiddle and end of the lateral.\nCatch containers or rain gauges are often omitted\nwithin 400 feet of the pivot point, as containers repre-\nsent a small area (less than 3 acres). Uniformly space",

The\nnearer to the outer end of the lateral, the shorter time\nperiod required for the lateral to pass over the catch\ncontainers. Let the lateral completely cross the con-\ntainers. The start-stop operation of self move systems,\nevaporation losses between night and day operation,\nand changing wind speeds and direction can cause\nnonuniformity in catch volume for a single spot. If this\nappears to be a problem, use two lines of containers or\nrain gauges at different lateral positions. Use the same\ncontainer spacing and start distance from pivot point\nfor both rows of catch containers. Water caught in\ncontainers positioned at the same distance from the\npivot point represent the same area on the lateral.\nAverages should be used. Identify tower positions\nwhen laying out catch containers for later reference\nwhen presenting results to the irrigation decision-\nmaker.\nIf containers are left for an extended time, a small\namount of mineral oil placed in them will reduce\nevaporation effects.\nStep 3—Calculate the average depth of water caught in\nall containers to find average application depth for the\nlength of lateral tested. The longer the lateral length\ntested, the more representative the average depth of\napplication. Testing the full length of the lateral would\nrepresent the total area, but requires more time. Oper-\nating pressure should be measured at several points\nalong the lateral.\nSpecial and unique field catch devices and evalua-\ntion procedures must be used for low energy preci-\nsion application (LEPA), low pressure in-canopy\n(LPIC), and low pressure systems using specialty\nheads.\n(iii) Continuous (self) move—This type sprinkler\nsystem includes the traveling gun sprinkler.\nEquipment—The equipment needed includes:\n• Soil auger, probe, push type core sampler.\n• Calibrated catch containers or rain gauges.\n• Pressure gauge with pitot tube attachment.\nSuggest using liquid filled pressure gauges for\nincreased durability plus the indicator needle\ndoes not flutter when making a reading.\nProcedures—The following procedures should be\nused in the evaluation.\nStep 1—Uniformly space catch containers or rain\ngauges across the path of the traveling sprinkler.\nCatch should represent a cross section of the total\napplication. When the sprinkler has completely passed\nover the catch containers, measure the depth of water\nin each can and record the distance from the sprinkler\ntravel path. Combine sprinkler catch where lap would\nhave occurred. Calculate the average irrigation appli-\ncation.\nStep 2—With water shut off, use calipers (for im-\nproved accuracy) to check inside diameter of nozzles\non big gun sprinkler heads. It is rather difficult and\nhazardous to check nozzle discharge with a hose and\nbucket or use nozzle pressure with a pitot tube on a\npressure gauge. If attempted, hold the driving arm\ndown to prevent sprinkler head rotation. An access\nplug that is often near the base of the big gun can be\nused to temporarily install a pressure gauge. Line\npressure should be corrected for elevation of the\nnozzle. Manufacturer charts and tables should be\nreferenced.\nUtilization of field data—The following steps\nshould be used with the field data:\nStep 1—Was the soil dry enough to start irrigating?\nWas it too dry? What was the soil-water deficit (SWD)\nat various locations in the field ahead of the sprinkler?\nfollowing the sprinkler?\nStep 2—Compare the soil-water deficit (SWD) to the\nwater application. How does the crop look? Is there\nevidence of under irrigation? salinity problems?\noverirrigation? Are there obvious sprinkler application\npattern problems? dry spots? dry strips? donut shaped\npatterns? wet areas?\nStep 3—Is there soil erosion, water translocation, or\nfield runoff? Is it general or only at specific locations?\nThese items indicate whether application rate is too\ngreat. A solution may be to improve irrigation water or\ntillage management rather than changing hardware.\nIncreasing traveler speed to apply less water or\nchanging tillage to increase soil surface storage are\nexamples of low cost management changes.\nStep 4—Are sprinkler heads positioned vertically? Are\nsprinkler heads rotating evenly and timely? Do sprin-\nkler head type, nozzle size, pressure, and lane spacing\nmatch the design?",

Devices used for catching discharge are\ngenerally home crafted so the catch device is\nfitted to the specific type of emitter device(s).\nExamples of catch devices are:\n— \tTroughs made from rain gutter (preferably\nplastic) or rigid plastic pipe (cut in half\nlongitudinally) for line source emitters.\n— \tSingle catch container for single emitters.\n— \tCut and fit 2-liter plastic soda bottles for\nminispray heads (fig. 9–13)\n• Watch with second hand or stop watch.\n• Pressure gauge with special adapters to fit poly-\nethylene pipe microsystem fittings.\n• Manufacturer emitter performance charts.\n• Measuring tape.\n(ii) Procedures—The following procedures should\nbe used for the evaluation.\nStep 1—Set catch devices under selected drippers or\nover minispray heads and sprinklers, or both. Check-\ning a few emitters can give an idea if a detail evalua-\ntion is necessary. Figure 9–13 shows a home fabri-\ncated catch device made from a 2-liter plastic soda\nbottle that can be used to catch flow from minispray\nheads and sprinklers. Check operating pressure at\nhead and end of lateral or wherever possible and\npractical. Fittings may need to be installed. A low\nrange reading pressure gauge (0 to 20 psi) may be\nnecessary to obtain reasonably accurate pressure\nreadings. Do not raise a micro irrigation emitter device\nmore than a few inches. Raising the emitter reduces\nthe operating pressure and discharge.\nStep 2—Use a probe or push core sampler to deter-\nmine wetted area and depth of water penetration for\nall types of emitter devices, including single and line-\nsource emitters for both surface installed and buried\nlaterals. Wetted width should reach the drip line of\nplants (perennials). Wetted depth should reach poten-\ntial root zone depth. For annual plants, such as row\ncrops, wetted width should be at a planned width, but\ngenerally not less than 50 to 65 percent of the total\nsurface area.\n(iii) Utilization of field data—The following steps\nshould be used with the field data:\nStep 1—Was the soil dry enough to start irrigating?\nWas it too dry? What was the soil-water deficit (SWD)\nat various locations in the field ahead of the emitter\nsystem? following irrigation? If soils are uniform, a\nprevious irrigation can be used.\nStep 2—Compare the soil-water deficit to application.\nHow does the crop look? Is there evidence of under\nirrigation, salinity problems, or overirrigation? Are\nthere obvious pattern or distribution problems?\nStep 3—Are visible emitters operating properly? Are\nminispray heads and sprinklers rotating evenly and\ntimely?\nStep 4—If possible, check the original design. Is the\nsystem being operated in accordance with the design\n(pressure, hours of each set, return frequency)?\nShould redesign be considered?\nStep 5—Are there excessive leaks? Are emitters or\nnozzles plugged? Is the filter system appropriate and\nbeing operated satisfactory?\nStep 6—Compare catch against manufacturer’s flow\nrate chart. Discharge variation could be because of\nplugging, inadequate or excessive pressure, excessive\nmain, submain and lateral head loss, or manufacturing\ndischarge variation.\nStep 7—Are there water, soil, or plant management\nchanges that can be made to reduce water use, water\nlost to nonbeneficial uses, and fertilizer use?",

The first-step procedures\ndescribed in 652.0904(c) should always be completed\nbefore deciding to expend the considerable time and\neffort required to do a complete irrigation system and\nmanagement evaluation. Each detailed system evalua-\ntion consumes from one to five staff person days,\ndepending on type of irrigation system. The objective\nof any evaluation is to improve irrigation system\noperation and water management.\nThe product for the irrigation decisionmaker would be\nan evaluation report and a comprehensive irrigation\nsystem operation and management plan. Depending on\nlocal concerns and priorities (i.e., water quantity or\nquality), it may be desirable to set up multi-agency\nsponsored IWM teams that have the necessary full-\ntime staff and equipment to provide assistance to farm\nmanagers and irrigation decisionmakers. Irrigation\ndecisionmakers should be present during the evalua-\ntion so they can observe measurements being taken.\nThe weighted importance (or effect) of measured\nobservations can also be discussed.\nIn addition to site specific benefits derived from a\ncomplete evaluation for the irrigation decisionmaker,\ncollected field data can support or modify estimated\nvalues in the local irrigation guide. The data can be\nused as a basis for future irrigation system planning\nand design. Another benefit is local on-the-job training\nopportunities for NRCS irrigation personnel. The best\nway to learn about planning, designing, and operating\nirrigation systems is to closely observe and evaluate\nirrigation system(s) operation and management as\nthey are taking place. Every person performing irriga-\ntion planning and design should occasionally go\nthrough a complete evaluation on each type of system\nbeing used in the area. It is a fantastic learning oppor-\ntunity. To become adequately experienced in irrigation\nto where sound knowledgeable and practical recom-\nmendations can be made, typically is a long-term\nprocess. True communication takes place when the\nirrigation decisionmaker perceives the consultant’s\nknowledge being equal to or expanded beyond their\nown.\nProviding detailed field evaluations is time consuming\nand must be comprehensive enough to provide de-\ntailed recommendations for improvements to both\nmanagement and system operations.\nThis part of chapter 9 describes procedures for per-\nforming detailed irrigation system evaluations. In-\ncluded are detailed procedures for performing irriga-\ntion system evaluations for surface, sprinkle, micro,\nand subirrigation systems and for pumps. Examples\nand blank worksheets are included in chapter 15 of\nthis guide.\n(1) Graded border irrigation systems\nImproving water use efficiency of border irrigation has\ngreat potential for conserving irrigation water and\nimproving downstream water quality. A detailed\nevaluation can provide the information for design or\nhelp to properly operate and manage a graded border\nirrigation system. It can help the irrigation\ndecisionmaker determine proper border inflows,\nlengths of run, and time of inflow for specific field and\ncrop conditions. It should also be recognized that soil\nintake characteristics have the biggest influence on\napplication uniformity. Intake rate for a specific soil\nseries and surface texture varies from farm to farm,\nfield to field, and throughout the growing season;\ntypically because of the field preparation, cultivation\nand harvest equipment, and other field traffic.\nTo approximate the infiltration amount (intake rate)\nbased upon advance and opportunity time for a bor-\nder, a correlation is made using cylinder infiltration\ntest data. A detailed irrigation system evaluation can\nidentify soil intake characteristics for site conditions\nwithin that particular field. It can also provide valuable\ndata to support local irrigation guides for planning\ngraded border irrigation systems on other farms on\nsimilar soils.\n(i) \tEquipment—The equipment needed for a\ngraded border irrigation system includes:\n• Engineers level and rod, 100 foot tape\n• Pocket tape marked in inches and tenths/hun-\ndredths of feet\n• Stakes or flags, marker for stakes or flags\n• Measuring devises for measuring inflow and\noutflow\n• Carpenters level for setting flumes or weirs.\n• Cylinder infiltrometer (minimum of 4 rings) set\nwith hook gauge and driving hammer and plate",

Use\nstandard soil surveys, where available, to locate bor-\nder evaluation sites. Then have a qualified person\ndetermine the actual surface texture, restricted layers,\ndepth, and other soil characteristics that affect irriga-\ntion. Soil surveys are generally inadequate for this\nlevel of detail. Almost all mapping units have inclu-\nsions of other soil. Extension of results to other areas\nalso has more reliability. The site selected should\nallow measurement of runoff if it occurs. The evalua-\ntion should be run at a time when soil moisture condi-\ntions are similar to conditions when irrigation would\nnormally be initiated. This procedure is described in\nthe following steps.\nStep 1—Obtain information from the irrigation\ndecisionmaker about the field and how it is irrigated;\ni.e., irrigation set time; borders irrigated per set with\ntypical inflow rates, advance rates (times), adjust-\nments made during irrigation set time, and number of\nirrigations per season; and tillage and harvesting\nequipment.\nStep 2—Record field observations, such as crops\ngrown, crop color differences in different parts of the\nborder or field, crop uniformity, salinity, and wet\nareas. Also make field observations concerning ero-\nsion and sediment deposition areas. The border to be\nevaluated should have uniform cross slope grade and\nuniform downslope grade.\nSet stakes or flags at 50- to 100-foot stations down the\ncenter of the border to be evaluated. Mark stations so\nreadings can be observed from at least 50 feet; i.e.,\nborder dike or adjacent border. Determine field eleva-\ntion at each station and for a typical cross section of\nthe border.\nRecord border width (center to center of border dike),\nstrip width (distance between toes of border dikes),\nand wetted width (width to which water soaks or\nspreads beyond the edge of dike).\nSet flumes, weirs, or other measuring devices at the\nupper end of the border and at the lower end if runoff\nis to be measured. Continuous water level recorders\nin the measuring devices may be convenient to use.\nPart of the objective during a detail evaluation is to\ndetermine infiltration rate under actual field condi-\ntions using cylinder infiltrometers. Set three to five\ncylinder infiltrometers in carefully chosen typical\nlocations within the border strip. Generally the most\nconvenient location is a couple of hundred feet from\nthe upper end of the strip (close to the water supply).\nContinuous water level recorders are convenient to\nuse in the infiltrometers. USDA publications reviewing\nthe installation of the cylinders are nearly nonexistent.\nSee Part 652.0905(b) for additional information on\ninstallation and operation of cylinders.\nStep 3—Estimate soil water deficit at several locations\nalong the border. Use the feel and appearance method,\nEley Volumeter/Speedy Moisture Meter, push type\ncore sampler and gravimetric, or some other portable\nmethod. Pick one location as being typical for the\nborder strip and record the data for that location on\nthe worksheet.\nStep 4—At the same time make note of soil profile\nconditions. With uniform soils, this can be done in an\nadjacent border during a later portion of the test when\ninfiltration rates are typically slower. Soil conditions\nto consider include:\n• Depth to water table\n• Apparent root depth of existing or previous crop\n(to determine effective plant root zone)\n• Restrictive (compacted) soil layers to root devel-\nopment and water movement; i.e., tillage pans\n• Mineral layers\n• Hard pans or bedrock\n• Soil textural changes",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–47\t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nInventory and data collection\nSteps to following during irrigation are:\nStep 1—Irrigate with inflow rates normally used by the\nirrigator, and record starting time.\nStep 2—Measure and record the inflow rate at 5- to 10-\nminute intervals until it reaches a constant rate. Dur-\ning the trial, periodically check inflow rate and record\nthe values. More frequent checks are needed if the\ninflow rate fluctuates considerably.\nStep 3—Observe and record how well water spreads\nacross as water advances down the border strip.\nStep 4—Record the time when the leading edge of the\nwater reaches each station. If the leading edge is an\nirregular line across the border strip, average the time\nas different parts of the leading edge reach the station.\nStep 5—Fill cylinder infiltrometers (rings) as the\nleading edge of the water flow in the border passes\nthrough the test site. An alternative to measuring\ninfiltration while the border is being irrigated is to\nbuild berms (or install a larger ring) around\ninfiltrometers being measured. Maintain water be-\ntween the berm and infiltrometer ring at the same time\nwater is poured into and measured inside infiltrometer\nrings. Using a hook gauge or other water level record-\ning device, record water levels in each infiltrometer at\ntimes shown on the infiltrometer worksheet. See\nprocedure and worksheets in section 652.0905, Soil\nintake determination procedure.\nStep 6—If there is runoff, record the time when it\nstarts. If outflow is being measured, periodically\nmeasure the flow rate and record the rate and time of\nmeasurement until it ceases.\nStep 7—Record the time when water is turned off at\nthe head of the border and the time water recedes past\neach station. This requires good judgment. On slopes\nof 0.5 percent or greater, a large part of the water\nremaining in the border strip when the supply is shut\noff may move downslope in a fairly uniform manner.\nOn these fields, record recession time at each station\nwhen the water has disappeared from the area above\nit. If the recession line across the border strip is irregu-\nlar, record the time when less than 10 to 20 percent of\nthe area is covered by water. Another method is to\njudge when there is about as much cleared area below\nthe station as there is above the station.\nStep 8—On slopes of less than 0.5 percent, a smaller\nproportion of the water moves down the strip. Some\nwater may be trapped in small depressions and may\nnot be absorbed for some time after surrounding areas\nare clear. The important thing is to determine when\nthe intake opportunity time has essentially ceased. The\nrecession time may be recorded for a station when 80\nto 90 percent of the area between it and the next\nupstream station has no water on the surface.\nStep 9—Immediately after recession, use a probe or\nauger to check depth of water penetration at several\nlocations down the border. A check at this time will\nindicate the depth to which water has already perco-\nlated. A ball type probe (a 1/2-inch diameter ball\nwelded onto the end of a 3/8-inch diameter push\nprobe) is handy for this task. In the absence of rock,\nthe probe inserts easily where soil has been lubricated\nby water, and stops abruptly when the wetted front\n(dry soil) is encountered.\nStep 10—If possible, check for adequacy and unifor-\nmity of irrigation time when the soil profile has\nreached field capacity. Sandy soils can be checked 4 to\n24 hours after irrigation. Clayey soils typically are\nchecked about 48 hours after irrigation when most\ngravitational water has drained.\nStep 11—If field capacity must be established, deter-\nmine the soil water content when checking the ad-\nequacy of irrigation. With uniform soils, a previously\nirrigated border strip can be used for this purpose at\nthe same time cylinder infiltrometer rings are being\nobserved.\n(iii) Evaluation computations—Information\ngathered in the field procedures is used in the detailed\nsystem evaluation computations.

A detailed evaluation provides information for\ndesign or to help properly operate and manage a level\nborder irrigation system. It can help the irrigation\ndecisionmaker use proper level border (basin) inflows,\nlengths of run, and time of inflow for the specific field\nand crop conditions. Soil intake characteristic has the\nbiggest influence on application uniformity. Intake\nrate for a specific soil series and surface texture varies\nfrom farm to farm, field to field, and throughout the\ngrowing season; typically because of the field prepara-\ntion, cultivation, and harvest equipment. A detailed\nirrigation system evaluation can tell us the soil intake\ncharacteristic for site conditions within a particular\nfield. It can also provide valuable data to support local\nirrigation guides for planning level border irrigation\nsystems on other farms on similar soils.\n(i) \tEquipment—The equipment for this evaluation\nincludes:\n• Engineers level and level rod, 100-foot tape\n• Pocket tape marked in inches and tenths/hun-\ndredths of feet\n• Stakes or flags, marker for stakes or flags\n• Flume, weir, or other measuring device to mea-\nsure inflow\n• Carpenters level for setting flume or weir\n• Gauge for measuring depth of flow in flow mea-\nsuring device\n• Gallon can(s) or larger for basin stilling well (for\nwindy conditions)\n• Soil auger, probe, push type sampler, shovel\n• Feel and Appearance Soil Moisture charts,\nSpeedy Moisture Meter/Eley Volumeter, Madera\nsampler with sample cans, or some other method\nof determining soil moisture condition\n• Level border evaluation worksheets, clipboard,\nand pencil\n• Soils data for field\n• Stop watch, camera\n• Boots\n(ii) Procedures—The field procedures needed to\nevaluate this system are in two main categories: gen-\neral and inventory and data collection.\nGeneral\nChoose a typical basin in the field to be irrigated. The\ntypical location should be representative of the type of\nsoil for which the field is being managed, from an\nirrigation scheduling standpoint. Use standard soil\nsurveys, where available, to locate border evaluation\nsites. Then have a qualified person determine the\nactual surface texture, restricted layers, depth, and\nother soil characteristics that affect irrigation. Soil\nsurveys are generally inadequate for this level of\ndetail. Almost all mapping units contain inclusions of\nother soil. Extension of results to other areas also has\nmore reliability. Basin size and configuration should\nbe typical of those in the field. The evaluation should\nbe run at a time when soil moisture conditions are as\nthey will be when irrigation would normally take\nplace.\nThe field evaluation procedure for basins and level\nborders uses the whole basin as if it were one large\ninfiltrometer. Inflow volume and volume of water in\nthe basin are measured. Because a small difference in\nwater level in the basin can represent a rather large\nvolume of water, water level changes must be mea-\nsured accurately.\nThe field evaluation procedure yields a two-point\naverage intake curve for the basin. The first point on\nthe curve is plotted at the time water is turned off. The\nsecond point is defined by plotting the gross applica-\ntion at the average opportunity time. If a more detailed\ncurve is desired or if plot points are desired at earlier\ntimes, a cylinder infiltrometer test can be run and\nplotted (see section 652.0904(g)(1) for procedure). The\nplotted curve is then adjusted in accordance with the\nmethods described in the procedures for graded\nborder evaluations.\nThis procedure will use a line of stakes in the direction\nof water flow; for example, down the center of the\nlevel border, to sample opportunity times. In most\ncases this gives adequate detail for analysis. Water\nflow in a square basin can be from corner to corner if\nwater enters at a corner.",

A more refined method of determining distribu-\ntion uniformity is to stake a complete grid in the basin\nand determine advance and recession times (and thus\ntime of opportunity) at each grid point. The additional\npoints give more measurements from which to work.\nThe procedure discussed should be sufficient to pro-\nvide data for making useful recommendations for\nmodifications in management or the irrigation system.\nThe graded border procedure for evaluation should be\nused when advance time exceeds half of the opportu-\nnity time required to fill the basin. You may be able to\nroughly determine these times before the evaluation\nby talking to the irrigator or by observing other basins\nthat have similar soils and inflow. The graded border\nprocedure involves taking cylinder infiltrometer tests\nand plotting and analyzing advance and recession\ncurves.\nInventory and data collection\nBefore irrigation starts:\n• Get basic information about existing irrigation\nprocedures, concerns, and problems from the\nirrigation decisionmaker.\n• Set stakes or flags at 50- or 100-foot stations\ndown the border. Mark stations on each.\n• Take rod readings on the average ground level at\neach station. Readings should be taken to the\nnearest 0.05 or 0.01 foot. Take readings at aver-\nage elevations at each measurement point.\n• Set several stilling wells within the level border\n(basin) for windy conditions.\n• Set the measuring device(s) to measure inflow.\n• Check the soil water deficit (SWD) at several\npoints in the basin. Use the feel and appearance\nmethod, Eley Volumeter/Speedy Moisture Meter,\npush tube/oven dry, or other acceptable method.\nFor the location chosen as the controlling typical\nsoil, record the SWD data on the evaluation\nworksheet.\n• Make note of soil profile conditions, such as:\n— Depth to water table\n— Apparent root depth of existing or previous\ncrops (for determining effective plant root\nzone)\n— Soil restrictions to root development; i.e.,\ntillage pans and other compaction layers\n— Mineral layers\n— Hard pans and bedrock\n— Soil textural changes\n• Record information about type of delivery sys-\ntem, type and size of turnout(s), width and length\nof level border or basin.\n• Make visual observations of the field including\ncrop uniformity, weeds, erosion problems, crop\ncondition or color changes, and salinity prob-\nlems. Are there areas receiving too much or not\nenough water?\nDuring the irrigation:\n• Irrigate with the inflow rate normally used by the\nirrigator and record the start time.\n• Check and record the inflow rate several times\nduring irrigation. Record when irrigation ceases\n(turn-off time).\n• Observe advance of the water front across the\nbasin. Record the time water reaches each sta-\ntion. Record the time in 24-hour clock readings.\nMake this reading as accurately as possible. A\nsmall error can make a large difference in water\nvolume. Record readings on the worksheet.\n• As soon as water into the basin is turned off, an\naccurate measurement of water surface elevation\nin the basin must be determined. This should be\ndone with rod readings to the nearest 0.01 foot. If\nthere is wind or other disturbance in the basin, a\nstilling well(s) should be set up in the basin to\nobserve water surface elevations. The well can\nbe constructed from a gallon or larger bucket,\nwith the bottom cut out and small holes punched\nor drilled in the sides below water level. This will\nbuffer wave action. Make sure the measurement\nlocation is far enough away from the turnout to\nnot be affected by flow from the turnout. Also,\nwater levels in large basins can vary 0.1 foot or\nmore. Be sure an average water level is used.",

An abbreviated\nmethod of evaluation was presented earlier in this\nsection. A detailed evaluation can determine onsite\nintake characteristics and provide information for\ndesign or to help operate and manage (fine tune) a\ngraded furrow irrigation system. It can help the irriga-\ntion decisionmaker use proper furrow inflows, lengths\nof run, and time of inflow for the specific field and\ncrop conditions.\nSoil intake characteristics have the biggest influence\non application uniformity. Soil intake rate for a spe-\ncific soil series and surface texture varies from farm to\nfarm, field to field, within each field, and throughout\nthe irrigation season because of tillage, harvest, and\nthe equipment used. A detailed irrigation system\nevaluation can identify what the soil intake character-\nistics are for the site conditions at a particular field. It\ncan also provide valuable data to support local irriga-\ntion guides for planning graded furrow irrigation\nsystems on other farms on similar soils.\nSee American Society of Agricultural Engineer Stan-\ndard ASAE EP419.1, Evaluation of Irrigation Furrows,\nfor an overall volume balance approach to furrow\nevaluation.\nObservations of the operating condition of delivery\nsystem and furrows should be made and recommenda-\ntions provided for solving any problems. The observa-\ntion should include:\n• Is erosion occurring? head cutting at lower end\nof furrow? at outlet of siphon or gated pipe? at\ngrade changes? Can erosion problems be solved\nwith conservation treatment measures, such as\nreduced tillage, no-till, mulching, vegetative\nstrips, crop rotation, or incorporating PAM in the\nwater supply?\n• Is sedimentation occurring as a result of furrow\nerosion? If so, is it occurring in furrow or in\ntailwater collection ditch?\n• Is suspended sediment in irrigation water caus-\ning reduced water infiltration as fine material\nsettles out?\n• Is trash or debris in water supply causing plug-\nging of siphon tubes or gated pipe outlets, result-\ning in uneven flow to furrows? Are gates opened\nexcessively wide to allow trash to pass through,\nresulting in excessive inflow to furrows?\n• Is subsurface drainage system operating satisfac-\ntorily? Is salinity management satisfactory?\n• Are facilities to control surface runoff in place\nand working properly?\n(i) \tEquipment—The equipment needed for a\ndetailed graded furrow system evaluation includes:\n• Engineers level and rod, 100 foot tape\n• Pocket tape marked in inches and tenths/hun-\ndredths of feet\n• Stakes, lath or wire flags for station identifica-\ntion\n• Flow measuring devices for measuring furrow\ninflow and outflow (When measuring furrow\ninflow where gated pipe or siphons are used,\npressure or head differential can be determined\nand flows calculated. A short piece of clear,\nsmall diameter tubing can be used to measure\nhead on outlets in gated pipe. With siphons, tube\nlength and head differential between inlet and\noutlet can be measured and standard discharge\ntables used to determine discharge.)\n• Carpenters level for setting flumes or weirs\n• Equipment for determining soil moisture con-\ntent, such as feel and appearance charts, Speedy\nmoisture meter and Eley Volumeter, or Madera\nsampler and soil moisture sample cans)\n• Calibrated container for measuring flow if siphon\ntubes are used\n• Soil auger or push tube probe and shovel\n• Clipboard, worksheets or evaluation forms,\npencil\n• Soils data for field\n• Watch\n• Rubber boots\n(ii) Procedure—The field procedures needed for an\nevaluation of this type system include:\nSite location— Choose a site location in the field to be\nirrigated. The typical location should be representative\nof the kind of soil for which the entire field is man-\naged. The site should allow measurement of runoff.\nThe evaluation should be run at a time when soil\nmoisture conditions are similar to conditions when\nirrigation would normally be accomplished.",

Inflow and\noutflow points can be anywhere within the field where\nit is convenient to obtain flow measurements. At least\nthree adjacent furrows or furrow groups should be\nmeasured at each test site. Adjacent furrows on each\nside of the test area should be irrigated simultaneously\nfor a total of five furrows irrigated. Evaluate wheel\nrows as well as nonwheel rows. This generally occurs\nwhere three adjacent rows are selected; however,\nthere may be two wheel rows and one nonwheel row\nor two nonwheel rows and one wheel row.\nThe entire furrow length should be evaluated; how-\never, if time for a full length of run evaluation is not\navailable, partial length rows can be evaluated. The\nminimum evaluation length for field evaluations\nshould be 200 to 300 feet for high intake soils and 500\nto 600 feet for low intake soils. Because of soil vari-\nability, shorter lengths, typically 100 to 200 feet, are\nused to derive values for preparing local irrigation\nguides. Lengths of 30 to 50 feet are used when using\nthe flowing furrow infiltrometer method.\nThe steps to follow during the detailed evaluation are:\nStep 1—Obtain information from the irrigation\ndecisionmaker about the field and how it is irrigated;\ni.e., irrigation set time, how many rows set, typical\nflow advance rate and total time, adjustments made to\nfurrow inflow during irrigation set time, number of\nirrigations per season, tillage pattern, and equipment.\nField observations include identifying furrow erosion\nand sediment deposition areas, crop color differences\nin different parts of the field, crop uniformity, salinity\nand wet areas, and drainage system operation.\nStep 2—Set flags or lath stakes at 100-foot stations\ndown the selected furrows (set flags only in the middle\nfurrow). Identify stations on each flag, lath, or stake.\nDo not walk in the furrows to be evaluated. Determine\nfield elevations at each station, and plot furrow profile.\nRecord furrow spacing (center of ridge to center of\nridge) and furrow cross section. Measure the cross\nsection with a straightedge and pocket tape or cross\nsection board.\nStep 3—Set measuring flumes, orifice plates, or other\nflow measuring devices at the upper and lower end of\neach furrow or reach to be evaluated. If there is\nponded water at the lower end of the field, locate the\nlower measuring station upstream of the backwater.\nStep 4—Estimate soil water deficit using incremental\ndepths throughout the root zone at several locations\nalong the furrow. Use the feel and appearance charts,\nSpeedy Moisture Meter, or some other highly portable\nmethod. Select one location as being typical of fur-\nrows irrigated and record data for that location on the\nworksheet.\nStep 5—Note soil profile conditions as you are re-\ncording soil water deficit data (step 4). Conditions to\nconsider include:\n• Depth to water table (if within 5 feet of soil\nsurface)\n• Actual plant root depth, root development pat-\ntern of existing or previous crop, and restrictions\nto normal root development\n• Compacted layers and mineral layers\n• Mineral layers\n• Hardpans or bedrock\n• Soil textures including textural change bound-\naries (abrupt or gradual)\n• Salinity levels and soil layers of salt accumula-\ntion\nField procedure for inventory and data collection:\nStep 1—Start furrow inflow with the flow rate nor-\nmally used by the irrigator and record start time. Time\npermitting, three different flow levels (high, medium,\nand low inflow rates) should be used in different test\nsections to determine effect of using higher or lower\nfurrow inflows.\nStep 2—At 5- to 10- minute intervals, check the inflow\nrate of the test section until it reaches a constant rate.\nRecord the flow rate and time of measurement each\ntime the flow is checked, Periodically during the\nevaluation check the flow rate and record it. Frequent\nchecks should be made if the flow rate fluctuates\nconsiderably.\nStep 3—Observe the furrow for erosion or overtop-\nping. Estimate the maximum usable stream size. For\nnew furrows, loose soil often muddies the water at\nfirst, but is not considered to be erosion. Also, some\nerosion often occurs at each turnout, but the furrow\nstream becomes stable after a short time. Looking\nclosely at the bottom of the furrow when water is",

If erosion is occurring, is there\nan opportunity to use PAM?\nStep 4—Record the time water reaches each station.\nRecord the time runoff starts at each outflow measur-\ning location. Periodically measure the flow rate and\nrecord the rate and time of measurement until it\nceases.\nStep 5—Record the time when water is turned off at\nthe head end of the field. In many cases the water\ndisappears from the furrow relatively uniformly\nthroughout the length of the furrow. In these cases\nonly the time water is shut off and the time water\ndisappears at each furrow station need to be recorded.\nNonuniform soil infiltration causes recession timing to\nbe erratic, so use your best estimate.\nStep 6—Before leaving the field, use a ball probe or\nauger to check depth of water penetration at several\nlocations along the length of the furrows. Suggested\nlocations are 1/3 and 2/3 points and at 80 percent of\nthe total furrow length. A check at this time indicates\nthe depth that the water has already penetrated. An-\nother check 24 to 36 hours later will indicate the final\ndepth of water movement. An estimate of final depth\ncan be made using a previous irrigation set on the\nsame soil. Check for adequacy and uniformity of\nirrigation when the soil profile is at or near field capac-\nity moisture level. A visit the next day may be neces-\nsary to observe wetted depth(s) in the soil profile\nwithin the area evaluated. Time for free drainage of\nmost gravitational water should be allowed. Sandy\nsoils can be checked a few hours after irrigation.\nMedium textured soils usually take about 24 hours\nafter irrigation, and clayey soils take about 48 hours.\nStep 7—Check the wetted soil bulb for a recently\nirrigated furrow and record the information. A trench\ndug across the furrow (stem to stem) is recommended.\nAlso, it is very productive to have the irrigation\ndecisionmaker present when viewing the trench. This\nis a good time to discuss what is happening in the soil\nprofile, especially if there are restrictive layers (which\nthere usually are).You need to observe the following:\n• Location and shape of wetted bulb\n• Actual root development pattern and location\n• Restrictive layers to root development and water\nmovement penetration; i.e., tillage pans\nIf it is desirable to establish or check soil moisture at\nfield capacity condition, determine the soil water\ncontent or collect samples when checking for ad-\nequacy of the irrigation.\n(iii) Evaluation computations—The information\ngathered in the field procedures is used in the detailed\nsystem evaluation computations.

Application\nefficiencies of 10 to 25 percent are common. Potential\nefficiencies with properly designed, maintained, and\nmanaged systems can be 30 to 50 percent. As an ex-\nample, improving application efficiency from 10 to 40\npercent where a net seasonal requirement of 17 inches\nis met, can conserve 10.6 acre-feet of water per irri-\ngated acre.\nExact values for distribution uniformity and applica-\ntion efficiencies are impractical to determine because\nof difficulties in measuring depth infiltrated at repre-\nsentative locations in the field. The depth infiltrated\nvaries widely throughout the irrigated area. The fol-\nlowing procedure gives an approximation of those\nfactors that are useful in making decisions about\nchanges that might be made to a system or its manage-\nment.\nChoose a typical portion of the field to be irrigated.\nThe site should have a representative soil type and be\nmanaged from a scheduling standpoint. If possible, the\narea irrigated should receive water from an individual\nturnout without water intermingling from other turn-\nouts. The size and shape of the area irrigated should\nbe typical of the size and shape of areas irrigated in\nthe field.\nIf water is intermingled from adjacent turnouts during\npreceding and succeeding sets, estimating or making\nonsite determinations of the adjacent water opportu-\nnity time is necessary at each grid point. Grid point\nopportunity times are explained in the procedure.\nThe evaluation should be run at a time when soil\nmoisture conditions are similar to those when irriga-\ntion would normally be initiated.\n(i) \tEquipment—The equipment needed for a\ncontour ditch irrigation system includes:\n• Two 100-foot tapes (or one 100-foot tape and\ntransit to lay out grid)\n• Stakes or flags and marker for stakes or flags\n• Flumes, weirs, or other measuring devices for\nmeasuring inflow and outflow\n• Carpenters level for setting flumes or weirs\n• Cylinder infiltrometer set with hammer and\nhammer plate (minimum 4 rings)\n• Hook gauge and engineering scale for\ninfiltrometer\n• Equipment for determining soil moisture\namounts (feel and appearance charts, Speedy\nMoisture Meter and Eley volumeter or Madera\nsampler, and soil moisture sample cans)\n• Buckets to supply infiltrometer with water\n• Soil auger, push tube sampler, probe, shovel\n• Evaluation worksheets, aerial photo of field, clip\nboard, and pencil\n• Watch, camera, boots\n• Soils data for field\n(ii) Procedures—The field procedures needed for\nevaluation of this type system are in two categories:\ngeneral, and inventory and data collection.\nGeneral\nStep 1—Before irrigation is started:\n• Get basic information about existing irrigation\nprocedures, concerns, and problems from the\nirrigator.\n• Select a turnout that irrigates an area representa-\ntive of areas irrigated from turnouts in the field.\nIf at all possible, select an area where runoff can\nbe measured.\n• Stake a grid in the basin to be irrigated. Grid\nspacing should be such that it defines significant\nundulations on the irrigated surface. The entire\narea irrigated from the turnout should be cov-\nered.\n• Sketch the location of ditches, turnouts, location\nof measuring devices, and the field grid on a grid\nsheet as illustrated in figure 9–25.\n• Set measuring devices to measure inflow and\noutflow.\n• Set three to five cylinder infiltrometers in care-\nfully chosen typical locations within the area to\nbe irrigated. A location near the supply ditch will\nbe the most convenient for providing water for\ninfiltrometer cylinders. See discussion in section\n652.0905, Determining soil intake.\n• Check the soil water deficit (SWD) at several\ngrid points in the irrigated area. Use feel and\nappearance, Eley volumeter/speedy moisture\nmeter, push tube/oven (Madera sampler), or\nsome other method. For the location chosen as\nthe controlling typical soil, record the SWD data\non the evaluation worksheet.",

Make visual observations\nof the field including crop uniformity, weeds, erosion\nproblems, crop condition or color changes, and wet\nareas.\nInventory and data collection\nDuring the irrigation:\n• Irrigate with the flow rate normally used by the\nirrigation decisionmaker and record the start\ntime.\n• Check and record the flow rate several times\nduring inflow. Record the turnoff time.\n• Observe advance of the water front across the\nirrigated area. On the map of the area, sketch the\nposition of the water front at six or eight time\nintervals. Using 24-hour clock readings, record\nthe time when the front reaches each station. An\nuneven advancing front line indicates location of\nhigh and low areas.\n• Fill the infiltrometer cylinders when the leading\nedge of water reaches them. (An alternative is to\nbuild dams around the infiltrometers and pour\nwater in the dams at the same time water is\npoured into the infiltrometers.) Record\ninfiltrometer readings at times shown on the\ninfiltrometer worksheets.\n• Record when runoff starts and stops. Check and\nrecord runoff several times during the runoff\nperiod.\n• Observe the recession of the water in the area.\nOn the map of the area, sketch the position at six\nor eight time intervals. Record the time on each\nline. These lines should be of contrasting color or\ntype to distinguish them from the advance line.\n• Immediately after recession, use a probe or\nauger to check depth of penetration at several\nlocations in the area. A check at this time indi-\ncates the depth that water has already perco-\nlated.\n• If overlap between irrigation sets has occurred or\nmay occur, the combined opportunity time must\nbe determined for the adjacent sets at those\npoints where overlap is experienced.\n• If possible, check for adequacy and uniformity of\nirrigation at a time when the soil profile has\nreached field capacity. Sandy soils can be\nchecked 4 to 24 hours after irrigation. Clayey\nsoils should be checked about 48 hours after\nirrigation when most gravitational water has\ndrained.\n• If it is necessary to establish field capacity,\ndetermine the soil water content when checking\nfor adequacy and uniformity of irrigation.\n(iii) Evaluation computations—The information\ngathered in field procedures is used in detailed system\nevaluation computations. Example 9–5 outlines the\ncomputations used to complete the Contour Ditch\nIrrigation System Detailed Evaluation Worksheet\n(exhibit 9–5).",

Nozzles, sprinkler heads, and\npumps wear (lose efficiency), and pipes and joints\ndevelop leaks. Some systems are used in ways they\nwere not designed. A sprinkler system evaluation is\ndesigned to identify problems and develop solutions.\nBefore a detailed evaluation is made, obvious operat-\ning and equipment deficiencies should be corrected by\nthe water user. However, observing and evaluating a\npoorly designed, installed, or operated system may be\na good training exercise to improve employee compe-\ntence. The following evaluation procedure works\nsatisfactorily with either impact or gear driven type\nsprinkler heads. Some modification to evaluation tools\nmay be necessary to check pressure and sprinkler\ndischarge.\n(i) \tEquipment needed—The equipment needed to\nevaluate a periodic move sprinkler system includes:\n• Catch containers and stakes—number of con-\ntainers equals:\nlateral spacing \tsprinkler spacing\n25\n×\n• Two 50-foot tapes\n• 500-mL (cc) graduated cylinder (use 250-mL\ngraduated cylinder for light applications).\n• Pocket tape (inches)\n• Miscellaneous tools—pipe wrench and adjust-\nable wrenches\n• Pressure gauge with pitot tube, 0 to 100 psi\npressure range (recommend liquid filled)\n• Soil auger, push tube sampler, probe, shovel\n• Equipment for determining soil moisture\namounts—feel and appearance charts, Speedy\nmoisture meter and Eley volumeter, or auger and\noven drying cans\n• Set of unused high speed twist drill bits, 1/16 to\n1/4 inch (by 64ths) for measuring inside diameter\nof nozzles on impact type sprinkler heads\n• Stop watch or watch with second hand\n• Wind velocity gauge, thermometer (for air tem-\nperature)\n• Calibrated bucket (2- to 5-gallon), 5-foot length\nof 5/8 inch diameter or larger garden hose, need\ntwo for measuring discharge from double nozzle\nsprinkler heads\n• Manufacturer's sprinkler head performance\ncharts\n• Clipboard and pencil\n• Soil data for field\n• Camera, boots, rain gear\n• Special adapter for measuring discharge from\ngear driven pop-up type sprinkler heads, if\nneeded\n• Worksheets\n(ii) Field procedures—The field procedures\nneeded to evaluate this system are in two categories:\ngeneral and inventory and data collection\nGeneral\nObtain pertinent information about irrigation system\nhardware from the irrigation decisionmaker and from\nvisual observation. Observe general system operating\ncondition, crop uniformity, salinity problems, wet\nareas, dry areas, and wind problems.

If at all possible,\nperform the evaluation on a day with no or little wind.\nWith lateral sets involving one move per day (24-hour\nset), it may be desirable to leave catch can containers\novernight.\nInventory and data collection\nThe following steps are needed to collect and inven-\ntory data:\nStep 1—Estimate soil-water deficit at several locations\nin the field. Use the feel and appearance, Eley volume-\nter/Speedy moisture meter, auger or push tube sam-\npler (Madera sampler), or some other method. Pick a\ntypical location, and record the data on the worksheet.\nStep 2—While completing step 1, also make note of\nsoil profile conditions including:\n• Depth to water table\n• Apparent root development pattern and depth of\nexisting or previous crop (for determining effec-\ntive plant root zone)",

The\nirrigator could install and remove it when laterals or\nsets are changed. Clamp-on ultrasonic flowmeters can\nalso be used effectively.\nStep 4—Choose a representative location along a\nsprinkler lateral for the test where pressure is typical\nfor most of the lateral. With one size of lateral pipe,\nabout half the pressure loss resulting from pipeline\nfriction loss in a lateral occurs in the first 20 percent of\nthe length. Over 80 percent of pressure loss occurs in\nthe first half of the lateral length. On a flat field the\nmost representative pressure occurs about 30 to 40\npercent of the distance from the lateral inlet to the\nterminal end.\nAlmost any container can be used. A sharp edge is\ndesirable. The 12- or 16-ounce clear plastic drinking\nglass works well. For straight sided containers, the\nentry rim diameter is measured and the equivalent\ncapacity in cc (mL) for 1-inch application depth is\ncomputed. For stackable tapered sided containers, a\n500 cc (or 250 cc) graduated cylinder is used to volu-\nmetrically measure catch in the cans. The cross sec-\ntional area of the top of the container is used to calcu-\nlate application depth, either in inches or millimeters.\nLarge sized rain gauges can be used as catch contain-\ners and can be read directly. To get mL conversion\nusing a circular container, measure the opening diam-\neter in inches and the conversion from mL to inches:\nm 4\nL D\n= \t×\nπ 2\n16 387\t.\nStep 5—Place bags over sprinklers affecting the test\narea. An alternative to this is to insert a small stick or\nplant stem along the side or into the impact arm of\nimpact type sprinkler heads to jam it open and prevent\nrotation. Make sure water does not get in the contain-\ners while they are being set out. Using a pressure\ngauge and pitot tube, hose, calibrated bucket, and stop\nwatch, check pressure and flow measurement at\nsprinklers next to the test area. All sprinklers on the\nlateral need to be operating.\nNote: \tLiquid filled pressure gauges are more durable\nand provide dampening of the gauge needle, allowing\npressure readings more easily obtained. Gauges\nshould be periodically checked against known pres-\nsures to determine potential errors. Purchasing a\nquality pressure gauge to start with is a wise invest-\nment.\nStep 6—Set out catch containers on a 10-foot by 10-\nfoot grid on both sides of the lateral between two or\nmore adjacent sprinkler heads. The grid pattern should\nbe continued perpendicular to the lateral for a dis-\ntance equal to the next lateral set location or just\nbeyond sprinkler throw radius, whichever is greater.\nThe last rows of catch containers on each side of the\nlateral will probably catch little water. See figure 9–28\nfor catch container layout and example catch data.\nEach container should be located at approximate plant\ncanopy height within a foot of its correct grid position\nand set carefully in an upright position with its top\nparallel to the ground. Any surrounding vegetation\nthat would interfere with a container should be re-\nmoved. To fasten containers to short stakes with\nrubber bands may be necessary. Personal ingenuity\nmay be necessary as to shape, height, and setting of\ncatch cans when evaluating low angle sprinkler heads\ninstalled close to the ground surface. It is necessary\nfor water to enter the catch container nearly vertical\nrather than horizontal.\nDuring hot, dry weather when long catch times are\nused, an evaporation container should be set upwind\nand away from the sprinklers. The container should be\nfilled with water at the start of the irrigation test, and\nthe amount of evaporation measured at the same time\nthe rest of the containers are read. Depth of water in\nthe evaporation container should approximate half the\naverage catch. This measurement approximates the\namount of evaporation that occurred from the catch\nduring the test period.\nQuickly remove the cloth bags or small sticks from the\nsprinkler heads to allow them to start rotating. Start\ntiming the catch.",

Check for wear and\ncorrect nozzle size. Nozzle size generally is indicated\non side of nozzle. Wear is considered excessive when\nthe drill bit can be moved about in the nozzle over 5 to\n10 degrees. Observe sprinkler heads for hang-ups,\nweak springs, and leaks. Impact type heads should\nrotate at 1 to 2 revolutions per minute. Determining\nthe actual size of sprinkler nozzles being used with\ngear driven heads using noncircular orifices is diffi-\ncult. The biggest cause of sprinkler irrigation applica-\ntion nonuniformity is mixed nozzle sizes.\nStep 8—Measure and record pressure and flow rate of\nsprinklers at several locations along the lateral line\nand at both ends, preferably at the beginning and end\nof the test period. Pressure is most accurately mea-\nsured with tip of the pitot tube in the jet stream at the\norifice. Inserting the tip of the pitot tube inside the\norifice restricts flow; thus, line pressure is measured\nrather than orifice discharge pressure. Typically the\ndifference is 1 to 2 psi. For most evaluations line\npressure is sufficient providing all measurements are\nline pressure or nozzle pressure.\nStep 9—Record how long it takes each sprinkler tested\nto fill a calibrated bucket. A short length of garden\nhose over the sprinkler nozzle is used to collect the\nflow in the calibrated bucket. To avoid modifying\nnozzle hydraulics, the hose should fit rather loosely.\nTime the flow into the bucket with a stopwatch. To\nimprove accuracy, determine the sprinkler discharge\nseveral times and compute the average. Use two hoses\nfor double nozzle sprinkler heads. It will take personal\ningenuity to develop a device to measure discharge\nfrom gear driven sprinkler heads. The head should\nrotate freely. A device similar to the that used when\nevaluating micro-irrigation systems (minispray heads)\nmay be adopted using a larger two-piece catch con-\ntainer.\nStep 10—Record wind speed, air temperature, and\nwhether humidity is low, medium, or high.\nStep 11—The test duration should be such that a\nminimum of 0.5-inch (average) depth of water is\ncollected in catch containers. Terminate the test by\nreplacing bags over the sprinkler heads or blocking\nhead rotation. Record the time.\nStep 12—Measure the depth of water caught in each\ncontainer by pouring water into a graduated cylinder.\nAn alternative to this is to use large commercial plastic\nrain gauges as catch containers as well as the evapora-\ntion container. The difference between the starting\nand ending depth in the evaporation container needs\nto be added to all catch container readings. Rain\ngauges can be read directly.\nStep 13—Record the catch data on a grid sheet. Show\nlocation of sprinkler heads and lateral pipeline in\nrelation to catch containers. Show north direction,\ndirection of pipeline flow, and prevailing wind direc-\ntion. Record nearby landmarks to locate the test area\nfor discussion purposes with the water user.\n(iii) Evaluation computations—The information\ngathered in the field procedures is used in the detailed\nsystem evaluation computations.

When only one lateral is operating or when operating laterals are\nnot adjacent, simulate sprinkler lateral overlap by transposing catch from one side of the lateral and\nadding to catch on the other side. Note that the row of containers that would be next to the lateral\nduring the next set must be added to the row of cans next to the test lateral. By doing this we assume\nthat the transposed half is the same as the same side of the next set. If catch on one side has been be-\nyond the lateral move distance, the row of cans next to the next lateral set should still be overlaid next\nto the test lateral location, and the extended cans added to the other side.\nAssume that the pattern for the next lateral set will have an overlap the same as the transposed half of\nthe evaluated set. This is not always true because the next set may have significantly different patterns\nas a result of wind or pressure changes. If changes are significant, additional evaluations may be\nneeded.\nThe worksheet is set up for transposing catch data.

Remember observed or measured data are not exact mainly because of the many vari-\nables. Irrigation system and management changes result from a calculated field trial and error procedure. The\nfield should be probed after each new trial to determine application distribution uniformity and water pen-\netration. Observations should be made to determine if translocation or runoff is occurring and to estimate the\namount. Determine if erosion is occurring, and, if so, what may be causing the erosion. Recommend ways to\nreduce the erosion. If water translocation, runoff, soil erosion, or a combination of these, are occurring,\nadjustments in application rate set time or equipment replacement may be necessary. Changes in cultural\npractices may easily solve the problem. Enough instruction should be given to irrigation decisionmakers so\nthey can make observations and adjustments themselves.\nMaking management changes is always the first increment of change. Recommending\nirrigation system changes along with appropriate management changes is secondary.\nExample 9–6 \tEvaluation computation steps for periodic move and fixed set sprinkler irrigation systems—Continued\n\n-- 374 of 754 --",

Some\nsystems are used in ways for which they were not\ndesigned. Sprinkler system performance evaluations\nare designed to identify problems and develop solu-\ntions. Before a detailed evaluation is made, obvious\noperating and equipment deficiencies should be cor-\nrected by the water user. However, observing and\nevaluating a poorly designed, installed, and operated\nsystem may be a good training exercise to improve\nemployee competence.\nThe following evaluation procedure works satisfacto-\nrily with most spray heads and all impact type sprin-\nkler heads. Modification and a bit of employee ingenu-\nity is necessary to use this procedure with self moving\nsystems using low pressure in-canopy (LPIC) or low\nenergy precision application (LEPA) type discharge\ndevices. Specially designed catch containers are\nneeded. Using rain gutters for application catch de-\nvices is one technique that can work with in-canopy\nflat spray heads and bubblers. Care should be taken to\nnot disturb foliage that would otherwise affect applica-\ntion uniformity. If at all possible, perform any evalua-\ntion when there is little to no wind.\n(i) \tEquipment—The equipment needed for a\nmoving lateral system includes:\n• Catch containers and stakes: number of contain-\ners equals:\nlateral length \t10\n30 ft 1/\n+\t( \t)\n1/ (30-foot spacing is maximum recommended.\nRefer to ASAE Standard S436 for recommenda-\ntions for more precise evaluations.)\n• 100-foot tape\n• 500-milliliter (cc) graduated cylinder (250 mL\ncylinder is sufficient for light applications.)\n• Pocket tape (inches)\n• Pressure gauge with pitot tube, 0 to 100 pounds\nper square inch pressure range\n• Flow measuring device (flow meter, velocity\nmeter)\n• Ohmmeter or electric ground check meter (tick\nmeter)\n• Soil auger, push tube sampler, probe, shovel\n• Equipment for determining soil moisture (fee\nand appearance soil moisture charts, Speedy\nmoisture meter and Eley volumeter, soil auger\nand oven drying soil sample containers)\n• Stopwatch, thermometer, wind velocity gauge\n• Ladder with hooks on top to fit over lateral\n(system will be moving during evaluation)\n• Raincoat, rubber boots\n• Manufacturer's pivot system design information\n(printout)\n• Clipboard and pencil\n• Soil data for field\n• Camera\n• Worksheets\n(ii) Procedures—The field procedures needed for\nthis system are in two main categories: general and\ninventory and data collection.\nGeneral\nObtain all pertinent system hardware information from\nthe irrigator and from visual observations. Observe\ngeneral system operating condition, crop uniformity,\nsalinity problems, wet areas, dry areas, translocation,\nrunoff, and other site characteristics. The following\nsteps should be used:\nStep 1—Obtain information from the irrigation\ndecisionmaker about the field and how it is irrigated;\ni.e., speed setting (%), rotation speed (hours per rota-\ntion), application depth per single pass or rotation, and\npasses or rotations per irrigation. Determine how\nmany irrigations or rotations are needed per season.\nStep 2—Estimate soil-water deficit at several locations\nin front of and behind the lateral. Observe if the full\nplant root zone was filled to field capacity. Use the feel\nand appearance, Eley Volumeasure and Speedy Mois-\nture Meter, auger or push tube sampler (Madera sam-\npler), or some other acceptable method. Select a\ntypical location and record the data on the worksheet.\nStep 3—At the same time, make note of such soil\nprofile conditions as:\n• Depth to water table\n• Apparent root development pattern and depth of\nexisting or previous crop (to determine effective\nplant root zone)",

The combination\nof a wet condition and electrical shorts can be\ndeadly. An ohmmeter or ground check meter (tick\nmeter) should be used to check for current leakage\nbetween pivot system and ground. The safety check\nshould be made when the towers are moving to help\nensure there are no electrical shorts in an individual\ntower drive motor. Each tower motor should have the\nopportunity to run during the check. Do not proceed\nwith the evaluation if electrical leakage is indi-\ncated. Too often electric operated systems have faulty\nelectrical systems. If no electrical shorts are indicated\nusing an ohmmeter or ground check meter, briefly\ntouch metal components with the back of the hand.\nElectrical current causes muscles to contract involun-\ntary, thus tightly closing the hand on the component.\nOnly after following the above safety checks should\nthe evaluation proceed.\nInventory and data collection\nStep 1—Select a location in the field to run test. Look\nat elevation change and undulations. Select a location\nrepresentative of the field being irrigated. You may\nneed to wait a few hours or schedule another day\nwhen the lateral is in a desirable location. Sometimes\nthe extreme condition is the operating condition an\nevaluation is intended to display. Running more than\none evaluation at different locations in the field and at\ndifferent times of day is desirable because of elevation\nchanges in the field, wind drift and evaporation losses\nbetween day time and night time, start and stop loca-\ntions during a test, flow or pressure variations, plus\nmany other variables.\nA difference in application from a lateral will be noted\nwhen a pivot system’s corner systems (guns or swing\nlaterals) are either operating or not operating. The\neffects of the start-stop operation characteristic (to\nmaintain alignment) and spray head patterns of self\nmove systems are sometimes apparent if two or more\ncatch tests are run at the same location on different\ndays. This is most noticeable with low pressure sys-\ntems where spray patterns are narrow. A minimum of\ntwo catch tests should be run before renozzling is\nrecommended. Where differences are suspected, two\nrows of catch containers can be averaged to more\nnearly represent actual conditions.\nStep 2—Determine flow into system. If a portable\nvelocity meter (similar to Cox velocity meter) is avail-\nable, insert the meter near the water source. Linear\nmove laterals with water source in the center may\nrequire two flow measurements to obtain flow going\nboth directions. The pitot device for this type meter\ncan be inserted through a standard small gate valve\n(3/4 inch). Typically, outlet fittings available on the\nlateral pipe within the first span are not used. A\nthreaded plug can be removed and replaced with a\nstandard 3/4-inch gate valve, or the valve can be in-\nstalled at the first sprinkler head before the lateral\noperates. A pitot tube velocity meter can then be easily\ninstalled and removed while the system is operating.\nClamp-on type ultrasonic flow meters can also be used.\nVelocities in the lateral pipe should be measured far\nenough downstream from any elbow to avoid exces-\nsive turbulence occurring just downstream of the\nelbow. To obtain a reliable average velocity, take\nseveral velocity readings across the diameter of the\npipe to position the pitot tube to read maximum ve-\nlocities. The change in velocity across the pipe diam-\neter is readily apparent. Measure and record flow data\nat start and end of the catch test. Flow, velocity, and\noperating pressure can change when other self move\nsystems within the same pumping system are turned\non or off during the test. On center pivot systems, end\nguns and corner swing laterals turning on or off affect\nflow rate and nozzle discharge along the lateral during\nthe test.\nWithout regularly scheduled maintenance and calibra-\ntion, flow data accuracy from onfarm system flow\nmeters is questionable. Poor water quality (debris,\nsediment, salts, manure, aquatic creatures) causes\naccelerated wear on impellers and bearings of flow\nmeters. Ultrasonic meters should only be used where\nturbulence and excessive air movement inside the\nconduit are minimal. To use only flow and velocity\nmeters that are regularly checked and calibrated is\nadvisable. Poorly maintained flow and velocity meters\noften provide readings that are 10 to 40 percent in\nerror from actual.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–136 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nStep 3—Determine operating pressure. As a minimum,\noperating pressure should be checked at the water\nsource point and near the far end. A pressure gauge\nmay be permanently installed, but do not rely on the\nreading it displays. Use a gauge that has been recently\ncalibrated or checked. If the evaluator does not want\nto get wet while checking operating pressures, gauges\ncan be installed and removed from sprinkler or spray\nhead fittings when the system is not running. Installing\na short 1/4 inch pipe nipple and ball valve generally\ncosts less than having personnel return to the site to\nremove a pressure gauge. If sprinkler heads are the\nimpact type, a pitot tube attachment in the pressure\ngauge can be used to measure operating discharge\npressure at the nozzle. A warm day is definitely desir-\nable when using a pitot tube to check operating pres-\nsures. Check pressure at several locations along the\nlateral if possible. Record pressure and location on\nworksheets.\nPressures can be more easily read when using a liquid\nfilled gauge. The liquid provides a dampening of the\ngauge needle and improves gauge durability.\nStep 4—Determine wind speed and direction, lateral\nline location, air temperature, and humidity level.\nRecord data on worksheets.\nStep 5—Step catch containers. For center pivot later-\nals, set catch containers on a radius along and in front\nof the lateral so the sprinkler lateral passes perpen-\ndicularly across the row(s) of containers. For linear\nmove laterals, set the catch containers in a straight\nrow in front of the lateral. Any catch container can be\nused; however, it must be calibrated. The catch con-\ntainer should have a sharp edge. For straight sided\ncontainers, the entry rim area is measured and the\nequivalent capacity in cubic centimeters (milliliter) for\n1-inch application depth computed. For stackable\ntapered sided containers, a graduated cylinder is used\nto measure catch in the containers. The cross sec-\ntional area of the top of the container is used to calcu-\nlate application depth either in inches or millimeters.\nLarge rain gauges can be used as catch containers and\ncan be read directly.\nSet containers in a straight line at any uniform interval\n(usually 30 feet). Start at the pivot point and extend to\na point beyond the wetted area at the outer end of the\nlateral. The lip of each catch container should be\nreasonably level. Move individual containers to avoid\ntower wheels. On water drive systems, containers\nlocated under driver discharge will collect abnormal\namounts of water. These should be relocated or dis-\ncounted during calculations. If crops are too tall to\npermit unobstructed catches with containers on the\nground, use short stakes and rubber bands to locate\ncontainers above foliage. Stakes holding catch con-\ntainers should not extend above the containers.\nStep 6—Allow the lateral to pass completely over the\ncontainers. With center pivot laterals, it may be desir-\nable to omit catch containers close to pivot point (first\none or two spans). The time it takes for the lateral to\ncompletely pass over these containers may be longer\nthan is desirable to complete an evaluation, unless\ncontainers can be left for several hours or overnight.\nAlso, the percent of field irrigated by the first one or\ntwo spans, is small on large pivots.\nStep 7—Read or measure the amount of water caught\nin each catch container. After the lateral has passed\ncompletely over all of the containers, measure and\nrecord catch volume or water depth. Use a graduated\ncylinder to measure volume of catch if tapered sided\ncontainers are used. Do not measure and record\nvolume of water or catch in containers that have\ntipped, partially spilled, or if it appears nearby foliage\naffected catch. Using a graduated cylinder for straight\nsided containers generally improves accuracy and can\nbe faster.\nIf containers are left overnight or for long periods\nduring hot and windy conditions, set out an evapora-\ntion can upwind of the test area. Fill the container\nwith a known volume of water (half of the irrigation\napplication depth is recommended) at start of test and\nthen record volume (depth) when other containers are\nmeasured and recorded. Evaporation adjustments\nshould be made on all readings. Use the same type of\ncontainer for both evaporation check and catch. A\nsmall amount of mineral oil added to each container\nprotects against evaporation losses.\nStep 8—Catch data reduction. With center pivot lateral\nevaluations, volume or depth caught in each container\nmust be weighted because the catch points represent\nprogressively larger areas as the distance from the\npivot increases. To weight the catches according to\ntheir distance from the pivot point, each container\nvalue must be multiplied by a factor related to the\ndistance from the pivot point. This weighting factor is",

A worksheet is set up with predeter-\nmined factor values.\nWhen evaluating linear move laterals, radial adjust-\nment of catch values is unnecessary as sprinklers\nmove in a straight path and each one irrigates the\nsame area regardless of their location along the lateral.\nFor the weighted low quarter average application\ndepths, the number of containers that represent the\nlow quarter of the irrigated area must be determined.\nThe low quarter is selected by picking progressively\nlarger (nonweighted) catches and keeping a running\ntotal of the associated position number until the subto-\ntal approximates a fourth of the sum of all catch\nposition numbers.\nStep 9—Determine maximum application rate. By\ncareful observation along the lateral, an area repre-\nsenting maximum infiltration rate for the present site\nconditions can generally be observed. No surface\nponding, translocation, or runoff should be occurring.\nTypically with medium textured soil, this location is\nabout 75 to 85 percent of the distance from pivot on a\nquarter mile lateral. This location varies with soil\ntexture, soil condition, surface storage, type of spray\npattern, and pressure of discharge device. Several\nmeasurements should be taken throughout the field\n(representing a specific soil series and surface tex-\nture) to represent a reliable value that can be used in\nthe local irrigation guide.\nTemporary surface ponding is a reliable method to\nextend infiltration opportunity time, especially on the\nouter end of low pressure, in-canopy sprinkler heads\n(including LEPA). No water translocation or runoff\nshould be occurring.\n(iii) Evaluation computations—The information\ngathered in the field procedures is used in the detailed\nsystem evaluation computations.

Nozzles, guns, and pumps wear (lose effi-\nciency), and pipes and joints develop leaks. Some\nsystems are used in ways they were not designed.\nSprinkler system evaluations are designed to identify\nproblems and develop solutions. Before a detailed\nevaluation is made, obvious operating and equipment\ndeficiencies should be corrected by the water user.\nHowever, observing and evaluating a poorly designed,\ninstalled, or operated system may be a good training\nexercise to improve competence. Some ingenuity is\nnecessary to check operating pressure of the sprinkler\nnear the nozzle. The high sprinkler gun discharge rate\nand the continuous moving system make field check-\ning of nozzle discharge unfeasible. Safety during\nsprinkler gun return rotation also is a factor. It is\nrecommended a calibrated pressure gauge be installed\nand the nozzle measured when the system is not\noperating.\nTypically, large traveling sprinkler guns are used on\nirregular shaped fields. With a flexible drag hose to\nconvey water and either a cable and power winch or\nslow-moving, self-contained, tractor-powered hose\nreel unit, the sprinkler gun operates as it moves along\na lane. Typical operating pressure is 75 to 100 pounds\nper square inch, and discharge from the sprinkler gun\nis 200 to 650 gallons per minute. Application rates near\nthe sprinkler gun are relatively high and decrease\ntoward the outer edge of the circle. For effectiveness,\ntraveling large sprinkler guns should apply water in a\nhalf circle rearward of the application device. This\nkeeps water and agricultural liquid wastes from spray-\ning the application device, and the device is traveling\non relatively dry soil.\n(i) \tEquipment—The equipment needed for a\ncontinuous move, large sprinkler gun type system\nincludes:\n• Catch containers and stakes\n• 50-foot tape\n• 500-milliliter (cc) graduated cylinder\n• Pressure gauge, 0 to 140 pounds per square inch\npressure range\n• Inside diameter measurement calipers\n• Soil auger, push tube sampler, probe, shovel\n• Equipment for determining soil moisture\namounts (feel and appearance soil moisture\ncharts, Speedy moisture meter and Eley\nvolumeter, or auger and oven drying soil sample\ncontainers)\n• Stopwatch\n• Wind velocity gauge, thermometer (for air\ntemperature)\n• Manufacturer's sprinkler head performance\ncharts\n• Clipboard and pencil\n• Soil data for field\n• Camera, boots, rain gear\nThe worksheet, Sprinkler Irrigation System Detailed\nEvaluation: Large Gun Type, is also needed. A copy of\nthis worksheet is in chapter 15.\n(ii) Procedure—The procedures needed for this\nsystem are in two main categories: general and inven-\ntory and data collection.\nGeneral\nObtain all pertinent information about system hard-\nware form the water user and from visual observa-\ntions. What are the irrigation decisionmaker’s con-\ncerns? Observe general system operating condition,\ncrop uniformity, salinity problems, wet areas, dry\nareas, translocation, runoff, and other site characteris-\ntics. The procedure is described in the following steps:\nStep 1—Obtain information from the water user about\ncrops, soils and how the field(s) is irrigated; i.e., travel\nspeed, lane spacing, lane length, pattern overlap,\napplication depth per irrigation. Determine the irriga-\ntions or application trips per season.\nDetermine sprinkler gun design specifications; i.e.,\noperating pressure, nozzle type (taper bore or ring\nnozzle) and inside diameter, system speed. Actual\ninside diameter can be measured with inside diameter\nmeasurement calipers when system is not operating.\nDepending on size and height of sprinkler gun, to\ninstall a pressure gauge may also be desirable when\nthe system is not operating. While the system is in\noperation, the height of the gun, configuration of the\nnozzle, and gun return rotations are hazards when\nchecking pressure at the nozzle. Using a pitot tube is\nnot recommended.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–153\t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nStep 2—Estimate soil-water deficit at several locations\nin front of and behind the traveler. Observe if the full\nplant root zone was filled to field capacity. Use the feel\nand appearance, Eley Volumeasure and Speedy Mois-\nture Meter, auger or push tube sampler (Madera sam-\npler), or some other acceptable method. Select a\ntypical location and record the data on the worksheet.\nStep 3—At the same time, make note of such soil\nprofile conditions as:\n• Depth to water table\n• Apparent root development pattern and depth of\nexisting or previous crop (for determining effec-\ntive plant root zone)\n• Root and water movement restrictions:\n— Compacted layers\n— Mineral layers\n— Hardpans or bedrock\n— Soil textures including textural change\nboundaries (abrupt or gradual)\nInventory and data collection\nStep 1—Select a representative location in the field to\nconduct the evaluation. Look at elevation change and\nundulations. Pick a representative location ahead of\nsprinkler. You may need to wait a few hours or sched-\nule another day when the sprinkler is in a desirable\nlocation. Sometimes the extreme condition is the\noperating condition an evaluation is intended to dis-\nplay. More than one evaluation may be needed at\ndifferent locations in the field and at different times of\nthe day because of the elevation changes in the field,\nwind drift and evaporation losses between daytime\nand nighttime, flow or pressure variations, plus many\nother variables.\nStep 2—Determine system flow rate. If a portable flow\nmeter is available, insert the meter in the flexible feed\nhose at or near a main line valve. Clamp-on ultrasonic\nflow meters can also be used if a straight section of\naluminum pipe can be inserted between the riser and\nflexible hose. Measure and record flow data at start\nand end of the evaluation period. Flow, velocity, and\noperating pressure can change when other sprinklers\nwithin the same pumping system are turned on or off\nduring the test.\nWithout regularly scheduled maintenance and calibra-\ntion, accurate flow data from onfarm system flow\nmeters is questionable. Poor water quality (debris,\nsediment, salts, manure, aquatic creatures) causes\naccelerated wear on impellers and bearings of flow\nmeters. Ultrasonic type meters should only be used\nwhere turbulence inside the conduit is minimal. Use\nonly flow and velocity meters that are regularly\nchecked and calibrated. Poorly maintained flow and\nvelocity meters often provide readings that are 10 to\n40 percent in error from actual.\nStep 3—Determine operating pressure. Operating\npressure should be checked at the sprinkler head in\nthe riser or near the nozzle. A pressure gauge may be\npermanently installed, but do not rely on the reading it\ndisplays. Use a recently calibrated or checked gauge. If\nthe evaluator does not want to get wet while checking\noperating pressures, gauges can be installed and\nremoved from sprinkler head fittings when the system\nis not running. A pitot tube attachment on a pressure\ngauge can be used to measure operating discharge\npressure at the nozzle, a process that is difficult and\nhazardous. A warm day is the most desirable time to\nfield check operating pressures using a pitot tube.\nSecure the rotating arm mechanism of a large gun type\nsprinkler before approaching the system. This helps to\nprevent unexpected rotation and possible injury.\nRecord pressure and location on worksheet.\nPressures can be more easily read when using a liquid\nfilled gauge. The liquid provides a dampening of the\ngauge needle and increased durability. Also, an adjust-\nment for elevation must be made (2.31 ft = 1 psi) when\npressure is obtained below the nozzle.\nStep 4—Determine wind speed and direction, lateral\nline location, temperature, and humidity level. Record\non worksheet.\nStep 5—Set out equally spaced catch containers in a\nrow in front of the sprinkler and slightly off the direct\nline of travel where the containers won’t be knocked\nover by the traveler or trailing hose.\nSet containers in a straight line perpendicular to the\nsprinkler line of travel, at any uniform interval (usually\n30 to 50 feet). Start at the center of the sprinkler gun\nlane line and set out catch containers evenly spaced to\nthe outer end of wetted area. The lip of the container\nshould be reasonably level and at approximate crop\ncanopy height. Use short stakes and heavy rubber\nbands to locate containers above foliage. The stakes\nshould not extend above the containers.",

Use containers with a relatively sharp edge.\nFor straight sided containers, the entry rim area is\nmeasured and the equivalent capacity in cubic centi-\nmeters (milliliters) for 1-inch application depth com-\nputed. For stackable tapered sided containers, a 500\ncubic centimeter graduated cylinder is used to mea-\nsure catch in the containers. The cross sectional area\nof the top of the container is used to calculate applica-\ntion depth, either in inches or millimeters. Large rain\ngauges can be used as catch containers and can be\nread directly.\nStart timing when the sprinkler wetted edges begins to\npass over containers. Time ceases when containers are\nno longer receiving water. The time it takes for the\nsprinkler to completely pass may be longer than is\ndesirable to complete an evaluation, unless containers\ncan be left for several hours or overnight.\nStep 6—Read or measure amount of water caught in\ncatch containers. After the wetted pattern has passed\ncompletely over all of the containers, measure and\nrecord catch volume or water depth. Use a graduated\ncylinder to measure volume of catch if tapered sided\ncontainers are used. Do not measure and record\nvolume of water or catch in any containers that have\ntipped or partially spilled or if it appears nearby foli-\nage affected the catch.\nIf containers are left overnight or for a long time\nduring hot and windy conditions, an evaporation\ncontainer should be set out upwind of the test area.\nFill the container with a known volume (depth) of\nwater approximating half the application depth.\nRecord volume (depth) at beginning and end of test.\nEvaporation adjustments should be made on all read-\nings. Use the same type container for both evaporation\ncheck and catch. A slight film (drop) of mineral oil can\nprovide some evaporative protection.\nStep 7—Catch data reduction. Because catch con-\ntainer locations for one pass do not reflect overlap\nfrom adjacent lane sprinkler gun trips, catch from one\nside of the wetted pattern that is in the overlap area\nmust be added to other side. Remember, wind causes\npattern distortion and influences overlap. Typically,\nwith traveling large gun type sprinkler heads, overlap\nis not 100 percent. Overlap distance can be determined\nin the field by measuring wetted diameter and lane\nspacing distances. The wetted distance in the outer\npart of the wetted circle past the midway point be-\ntween lanes is the overlap area.\nStep 8—Determine the sprinkler travel speed. Set a\nstake next to the sprinkler. Start timing when a spe-\ncific part of the sprinkler gun moves past the stake.\nAfter at least 20 minutes with the sprinkler gun in\noperation, set a second stake in line with the same\npart of the sprinkler gun in its new position. Record\ntime required for travel between stakes or marks and\nmeasure the distance. Some stationary time at the end\nof each lane will provide adequate irrigation at edge of\nfield. Speed is determined as follows:\nSpeed, ft/min distance traveled, ft\ntime, min\n=\nNote: The travel speed of some hose reel sprinklers\nvaries because of a constant hose reel velocity irre-\nspective of the effective reel diameter the hose is\nbeing wound (or unwound).\n(iii) Evaluation calculations—The information\ngathered in the field procedures is used in the detailed\nsystem evaluation computation.

Speed is based on depth of water\napplied, gun discharge, and spacing between lanes. Depth of water applied is based on the equation:\nGross Ave. depth of water applied 1,605 \tsprinkler discharge, gpm\nlane spacing, ft \ttravel speed, ft/min\n= × ( \t)\n( \t) × ( \t)\nFor ease of use, table 6–10 in chapter 6, section 652.0602(e) of this guide displays this equation in table\nformat. Depending on site conditions (soil, slope, vegetative cover) and application rate, catch containers\nmay not reflect water actually infiltrated because of the water translocation and runoff that occurred.\nWater translocation and runoff are often greater with large sprinkler gun travelers because of the large\nwater droplet size and velocity upon impact with the ground surface. To obtain net depth of application,\nassume an application efficiency or determine soil moisture replacement in the plant root zone. Applica-\ntion efficiency of the low quarter, Eq, ranges from 55 to 67 percent where there is little to no wind and\nwith no water translocation or field runoff.\n2. \tDetermine system capacity using flow data from a flow meter. Read direct in gallons per minute or\nconvert as necessary. System capacity flow container can also be determined using velocity meter data\nfrom the equation:\nQ = A V\nwhere:\nQ = flow in system, ft 3/s\nA = cross sectional area of pipe, ft2\nV = average velocity in pipe, ft/s\nConversion units: 1.0 ft 3/s = 450 gpm (approximate)\n3. \tPrepare a plot of catch container data. Plot the adjusted depth of water (include adjustment in over-\nlap area) caught in containers (inches) against the location of the container with respect to the sprinkler\ngun travel path centerline. Average catch is calculated using total catch and dividing by number of con-\ntainers. Plot this line on the graph. This cross section graph can be one of the best tools for explaining the\nresults of the evaluation to the irrigation decisionmaker.\n4. \tDetermine maximum application rate. An approximation of maximum application rate is determined\nby using data from catch container(s) with maximum depth of water caught. The maximum average\napplication rate (over entire time water was applied at the specific catch container site) is computed as\ncatch in inches divided by time in hours of test. Since water application pattern approximates a parabola\nshape (from an adequately operating sprinkler head), maximum rate is about 1.5 times the maximum\naverage rate.\nMaximum application rate, in/hr = (average application rate, in/hr) x 1.5\nSee section 652.0905(f), Continuous/self move sprinkler, field procedure step 9, for a method to measure\nmaximum application rate.\nExample 9–8 \tEvaluation computation steps for continuous move, large gun type sprinklers",

The objective of micro irrigation is to main-\ntain a high soil moisture content in the plant root zone\nat all times during the irrigation season. This can be\naccomplished by starting the season with high soil\nmoisture content and replacing the amount depleted\nby the plant (and some to evaporation) on a 1- to 4-day\nbasis. This is done by delivering the amount of water\nneeded directly to the root zone of each plant through\na controlled delivery system.\nTo accomplish this objective the system must be\nadequately designed and constructed. A monitoring\nmethod to determine the amount of water needed on a\ndaily basis and a method to verify the validity of both\nthe delivery system performance and the amount of\nwater delivered as being adequate are also required.\n(i) \tComponents—The various components of a\nmicro irrigation system are shown in a typical layout\nas in figure 9–29. An adequate filter system is neces-\nsary to ensure performance of the controlled delivery\n(emitters, spray heads, bubblers) at each plant without\nclogging. Clogged application devices cause poor\ndistribution along the laterals.\nMicro irrigation only wets a portion of the soil volume\nallocated to each plant or row of plants. Where the\nvolume of soil irrigated is small, root growth can be or\nis restricted. The percentage of the wetted area com-\npared to the total area for each plant depends on the\nemitter discharge area, discharge rate, spacing of\nemitters, and soil type. The preferred measure is based\non the volume of soil irrigated compared to the total\nvolume available to each plant. Where more than one\nemitter is used per plant, the wetted volume created\nby each emitter should overlap in the upper part of the\nplant root zone as shown in figure 9–30. Where salts\nare a problem, the overlap should be at the ground\nsurface so salts are not concentrated within the root\nzone.\nOne of the objectives in evaluating a micro irrigation\nsystem is to determine the average volume of soil\nwetted per plant. Minimum soil wetted volume ap-\npears to be about a third for vines and orchards, and\nhigher for close spaced row crops, such as potatoes,\ncotton, and tomatoes.\nThe total plant area does not need irrigating, but\noverlap should occur in the upper half of the plant\nroot zone and be continuous along the plant row.\nThe successful operation of a micro irrigation system\nrequires the frequency of irrigation and volume of\nwater applied be carefully scheduled to meet plant\nFigure 9–29 \tTypical split flow layouts for micro irrigation\nsystem\nBlock \tIII\nBlock \tIV\nBlock \tI\nBlock \tII\nMain line\nManifold\nSubmain\nWater supply\nand control\nhead\nControl\nvalves\nLaterals\nwith\nemitters\nLaterals\nwith\nemitters\nSubmain\nRooting depth\nof plant\nWetted area\nEmitter\tEmitter\nD\n2\nD\nD\n2\nTotal plant area\nFigure 9–30 \tTypical wetted area under a plant with two\nemitters",

Under-irrigation is easier to\ndetect than overirrigation. Overirrigation is lost to\ndeep percolation and may not be apparent unless the\nwater applied is compared to the plant ET. Properly\ndesigned, installed, and operated micro irrigation\nsystems have the capability to place over 90 percent of\napplied water available for plant use. In reality 65\npercent is more common because of inadequate irriga-\ntion scheduling resulting in the application of too\nmuch water.\nThe soil salinity level should be checked at various\nlocations from the plant and for various depths to\ndetermine if salt buildup is becoming a problem.\nWhere checked periodically, the change in salinity\nover time is noted.\nField emission uniformity, EU, must be known to\nproperly manage the amount of water applied. Be-\ncause EU can change throughout the irrigation season,\nperiodic evaluations are needed to determine mainte-\nnance needs and irrigation scheduling changes.\n(ii) Evaluation process—Use of much of the\ninformation is similar to field data and analysis for\norchard sprinkler irrigation system. The data needed\nfor evaluating a micro irrigation system can be ob-\ntained by determining:\n• Duration, frequency, and sequence of operation\nof a normal irrigation cycle\n• Soil-moisture deficit and management allowable\ndepletion\n• Rate of discharge and pressure near several\nemission points spaced throughout the system\n• Changes in rate of discharge from emitters after\ncleaning or other repair\n• Percent of soil volume wetted\n• Spacing and size of trees, vines, or other plants\nbeing irrigated\n• Location of emission points relative to trees,\nvines, or other plants, and uniformity of spacing\nof emission points.\n• Pressure drop at the filter(s)\n• General topography\n(iii) Equipment—The equipment needed for a micro\nirrigation system includes:\n• Pressure gauge (0 to 50 psi range) with adapters\nfor temporary installation at either end of lateral\nlines\n• Stopwatch\n• Graduated cylinder (250 to 500 mL capacity)\n• Funnel thave has a 3- to 6-inch diameter\n• Shovel, soil auger, or push tube sampler, probe\n• Manufacturer’s emitter performance charts\nshowing the relationships between discharge and\npressure plus recommended operating pressures\nand filter requirements\n• Shop built emitter and spray head catch contain-\ners\n• Sheet metal or plastic troughs 3 feet long for\nmeasuring the discharge from several outlets in a\nperforated lateral simultaneously or the dis-\ncharge from a 3-foot length of porous tubing (a\npiece of 1 1/2 or 2 inch diameter PVC pipe cut in\nhalf lengthwise works well)\n• Micro Irrigation System Detailed Evaluation\nWorksheet (see chapter 15)\n(iv) Procedure—The following field procedure is\nsuitable for evaluating systems with individually\nmanufactured emitters and systems that use perfo-\nrated or porous laterals. Record data on evaluation\nworksheets while collecting the field information.\nStep 1—Collect or determine soil and crop character-\nistics throughout the field.\nStep 2—Determine from the irrigation decisionmaker\nthe duration and frequency of irrigation and the con-\ncept of applicable MAD.\nStep 3—Check and note the pressure at the inlet and\noutlet of the filter(s) and, if practical, inspect the\nscreens for breaks and other possibilities for contami-\nnants to bypass the screen(s).\nStep 4—Collect emitter and lateral information.\nStep 5—Locate four emitter laterals along an operating\nmanifold; one should be near the inlet, two near the\nthird points, and the fourth near the outer end. Sketch\nthe system layout and note the general topography,\nmanifold in operation and manifold where the dis-\ncharge test is conducted.\nStep 6—Record system discharge rate and the number\nof manifolds and blocks (or stations). The number of\nblocks is the total number of manifolds divided by the\nnumber of manifolds in operation at anyone time.",

Collect the discharge for a number of full\nminutes (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) to obtain a volume between\n100 and 200 milliliters for each emission point tested.\nConvert each reading to milliliters per minute before\nentering the data on the worksheet. To convert millili-\nters per minute to gallons per hour, divide milliliters\nper minute by 63.\nThese steps produce 8 pressure readings and 32 dis-\ncharge volumes at 16 different plant locations for\nindividual emission points used in wide-spaced crops\nwith two or more emission points per plant. For perfo-\nrated tubing, bi-wall, or porous tubing, use a 3- to 5-\nfoot trough and collect a discharge volume at each of\nthe 16 locations described. These are already averages\nfrom two or more outlets, so only one reading is\nneeded at each location. Care should be taken to avoid\nraising an emitter or hose more than a few inches\nbecause any raise in elevation reduces discharge\npressure and volume.\nFor relatively wide-spaced crops, such as grapes,\nwhere a single outlet emitter or bubbler may serve one\nor more plants, collect a discharge reading at each of\nthe 16 locations described. Since the plants are only\nserved by a single emission point, only one reading\nshould be made at each location.\nStep 8—Measure and record water pressures at the\ninlet and downstream ends of each lateral tested,\npreferably under normal operations. On the inlet end,\nthis requires disconnecting the lateral hose, installing\nthe pressure gauge, and reconnecting the lateral be-\nfore reading the pressure. On the downstream end, the\npressure can be read after connecting the pressure\ngauge the simplest way possible. Be sure to flush the\nline of sediment and debris before installing the pres-\nsure gauge.\nStep 9—Check the percentage of soil wetted at one of\nthe plant locations on each test lateral. It is best to\nselect a plant at a different relative location on each\nlateral. Use a push probe, soil auger, or shovel for\nestimating the actual extent of the wetted zone below\nthe surface around each plant. Determine the percent-\nage wetted by dividing the wetted area by the total\nsurface area between four plants.\nStep 10—If an interval of several days between irriga-\ntions is being used, check the SMD in the wetted\nvolume near a few representative plants in the next\nblock to be irrigated. This is difficult and requires\naveraging samples taken from several positions\naround each plant.\nStep 11—Determine the minimum lateral inlet pres-\nsure (MLIP) along each operating manifold. For level\nor uphill manifolds, the MLIP is at the far end of the\nmanifold. For downhill manifolds it is often about two-\nthirds the distance down the manifold. With manifolds\non undulating terrain, MLIP generally is located on a\nknoll or high point.\nStep 12—Determine the discharge correction factor\n(DCF) to adjust the average emission point discharges\nfor the tested manifold. This adjustment is needed if\nthe test manifold happened to be operating with a\nhigher or lower MLIP than the system average MLIP. If\nthe emitter discharge exponent, x, is known, use the\nsecond formula presented.\nStep 13—Determine the average and adjusted average\nemission point discharges.\n(v) \tEvaluation computations—In micro irrigation\nall of the system flow is delivered to individual trees,\nvines, shrubs, plants, rows of plants, or blocks of turf.\nEssentially, the only opportunity for loss of water is at\nthe tree or plant locations. Therefore, uniformity of\nemission is of primary concern, assuming the crop is\nuniform. Locations of individual emission points, or\nthe tree locations where several emitters are closely\nspaced, can be thought of in much the same manner as\ncontainer positions in tests of periodic move sprinkler\nperformance.\nIn exhibit 9–8, there are four single emission points\n(emitters) per tree in the citrus grove where data were\nobtained. Therefore, discharge from the two emitters\nat each tree can be averaged. The minimum rate of\ndischarge (or low quarter) is then the adjusted average\ndischarge of the lowest four (average) discharges per\ntree, 2.30 gallons per hour for the example evaluation.\nThe adjusted average rate of discharge per tree for the\nentire system was 2.65 gallons per hour. Example 9–9\nshows the computations used for a micro irrigation\nsystem evaluation.",

Because micro irrigation wets only a portion of the total soil volume, the SMD must be replaced\nfrequently. SMD is always difficult to estimate because parts of the wetted root zone often remain near field\ncapacity even when the interval between irrigations is several days.\nFor the example evaluation where irrigations are applied everyday, SMD is practically impossible to estimate.\nFor this reason, SMD must be estimated from weather data or information derived from evaporation devices\neven though such estimates are subject to error. Because checking for slight under-irrigation is not practical,\nsome margin for safety should be allowed. As a rule, about 10 percent more water than the estimated SMD or\nevapotranspiration should be applied to the least watered areas. Thus the PELQ under full micro irrigation\ncan be estimated by:\nPELQ = 0.9 x EU\nFor the example test data:\nPELQ = 0.9 x 87 % = 78%\nIn a micro irrigation system, all field boundary effects or pressure variations along the manifold tested are\ntaken into account in the field estimate of EU. Therefore, the estimated PELQ is an overall value for the\nmanifold in the subunit tested except for possible minor water losses resulting from leaks, draining of lines,\nand flushing (unless leaks are excessive).\nSome micro irrigation systems are fitted with pressure compensating emitters or have pressure (or flow)\nregulation at the inlet to each lateral. However, most systems are only provided with a means for pressure\ncontrol or regulation at the inlets to the manifolds as was the case with the example system evaluated. If\nmanifold inlet pressures are not properly set, the overall system PELQ is lower than the PELQ of the test\nmanifold. An estimate of this efficiency reduction factor, ERF, can be computed from the minimum lateral\ninlet pressure, MLIP, along each manifold by:\nE F average MLIP \t1.5 \tminimum MLIP\naverage MLIP\nR \t= + \t×\t( \t)\n×\t2 5\t.\nThe ratio between the average emission point discharges in the manifold with the minimum pressure and the\nsystem is approximately equal to ERF. Therefore, the system PELQ can be approximated by:\nSystem PELQ = ERF x example PELQ\nUsing the data from the example evaluation and PELQ = 78%, find ERF:\nE F\tR \t= + \t×\t( \t)\n× =\n46 1 \t1 5 \t42\n2 5 \t46 1 0 95\n. \t.\n. \t. .\nand,\nSystem PELQ = 0.95 x 78 % = 74 %\nExample 9–9 \tEvaluation computation steps for micro irrigation systems—Continued",

Effectiveness of a micro system\ncan be estimated by how much of the applied water is stored in the root zone and is available for consumptive\nuse by the plants.

Furthermore, the average depth applied to the total area, Da, was only 0.21\ninch per day, which is hardly sufficient to meet the expected consumptive use requirements for mature citrus\ntrees at the example evaluation location.

Pressure variations of 20 percent\nfor orifice-type emitters and 10 percent for long tube type result in flow differences of about 10 percent.\nObviously each control valve must be adjusted accurately to ensure uniform pressures throughout the field;\nhowever, this was not the case as noted by the minimum lateral inlet pressure variations between manifolds\nas data collected shows.\nUniformity of application throughout the operating manifold, expressed by the EU of 87 percent, was good.\nBecause pressures were nearly constant, most of the lack of application uniformity resulted from variations\nin operation of the individual emitters. Discharges of emitters A and B at the same location, which would\nhave almost identical pressures, often differed considerably.\nDifferences in elevation throughout the system were not extreme, so the other manifolds should have pro-\nduced similar uniformities.\nThe percentage of wetted area ranged between 26 and 31 percent. This is less than the recommended mini-\nmum discussed in the introduction for arid areas.\nFor the fertilizer application program, urea was injected into the irrigation water to meet nitrogen needs.\nOther fertilizers were being applied directly to the soil surface and incorporated by cultivation in the fall\nbefore the rainy season. This fertilizer program should prove satisfactory and cause no problem with the\nirrigation equipment.\nEmitters—The emitters used in the recorded test were automatic flushing type. The variations in discharge\nprobably resulted from differences in manufacturing tolerances. These emitters, operating at pressures near\n45 pounds per square inch, averaged a discharge of 2.62 gallons per hour, which is considerably less than the\nrated 3 gallons per hour at 30 pounds per square inch. This indicates that the orifices may be closing slowly or\nclogging after about one season’s operation.\nVariable clogging can cause large differences in flow from nonflushing emitters even though manufacturing\ntolerance may be close. Some emitters can be flushed manually. Systems having manually flushed emitters\nshould be flushed monthly, and the change in flow before and after flushing determined. Some outlet emitters\nare pressure compensating; thus, discharge is constant over a range in pressure variations. Bubbler systems\ntypically use 1/4 to 3/8 inch diameter tubing for outlets where clogging from suspended sediment is not a\nproblem. Insects that build nests in small cavities can be a problem.\nExample 9–9 \tEvaluation computation steps for micro irrigation systems—Continued",

Small safety screen filters were installed at the inlet to\neach lateral. This precaution is recommended. Several of these screens were checked at random. All were\nfound reasonably clean; however, several screens had intercepted a considerable amount of coarse material\nthat would have clogged emitters had it passed through the laterals. The operator said that each screen was\nroutinely cleaned after every 1,000 hours of operation.\nChanging to a 12-hour irrigation on alternate days instead of continuing the present 6 hours per day could\nimprove the percentage of wetted area because longer applications wet more soil volume. No problems of\ninfiltration were apparent, and the average depth applied to the wet area, D a, of 0.73 inch could be doubled\nwithout exceeding the SMD at a MAD of 30 percent. For example, a total of 8 inches of moisture would be\navailable. The depletion of 2 x 0.73 = 1.46 inches gives a MAD of less than 20 percent in the wetted area.\nManifold inlet valves should be adjusted to give the same minimum lateral inlet pressure on each manifold.\nThis increases the system PELQ and AELQ to the PELQ and AELQ of the tested manifold, which is a 5 per-\ncent improvement.\nIt appears emission from laterals has been gradually decreasing, and the system was designed to yield greater\nflow than was observed. Thus, adding emitters could restore the systems capacity to the original 12 gallons\nper hour per tree at an average operating pressure of 30 pounds per square inch, while increasing the percent\nwetted area to almost 40 percent.\nThe only sure way to improve EU would be to replace the emitters. This is costly and may not be warranted at\nthis time. Chemical treatment may clean some of the mineral deposits and partly restore discharge rate and\nuniformity.\nOverall minimum depth applied to the total area, D a, (only 0.17 inch per cycle) seems to be marginal for a\nmature citrus grove during the peak water demand period. Although emitters were rated at 3 gallons per hour\nwhen operated at 30 pounds per square inch, the test results in the field indicated an average rate of flow of\n2.62 gallons per hour at 45 pounds per square inch. To meet peak demands of water, the flow rate per tree\nmust be restored to the original design of 12 gallons per hour (four emitters at 3 gph) by cleaning or otherwise\nrepairing the emitters, or by adding another emitter to the system at each tree.\nSummary\nThe EU of 87 percent and estimated PELQ of 78 percent of the tested manifold are good. Main system prob-\nlems are associated with a marginal amount of soil wetted (only about 30%), poor manifold control valve\nadjustment, and low rates of flow in the system. The irrigation decisionmaker was advised to try scheduling\nthe irrigation to apply water for 12-hour periods on alternate days instead of continuing the current 6 hours\nper day cycle. He was also urged to:\n• Adjust the manifold control valves to obtain equal minimum lateral inlet pressure on all manifolds (it is\nsuggested fittings be installed to allow the use of pressure gauges).\n• Clean or repair the emitters, or add an extra emitter at each tree to restore flow rates to the designed\nvolume and to increase the percent of wetted area.\nExample 9–9 \tEvaluation computation steps for micro irrigation systems—Continued",

Wear ring and impeller wear, corrosion,\nand metal erosion (cavitation) can affect the efficiency\nof a pump. Intake screen plugging and pipeline leaks\nalso affect efficiency. Leaks on suction piping are\noften caused by pinholes in welded joints and loose\ncouplers. Pumps are often used under conditions other\nthan those for which they were designed. Changes in\nthe irrigation system after pump installation often\noccur. Some pumps are purchased second hand and\nused in non-optimum situations. Another frequent\nproblem is poor intake and outlet piping configura-\ntions. Such problems can dramatically lower pump\nefficiency. The purpose of a pump evaluation is to\nidentify these problems, determine annual cost attrib-\nuted to the problems, and make recommendations for\nmodifications to improve operating efficiency and\nreduce energy use. A pump analysis should be consid-\nered part of a complete irrigation system analysis.\nNational Engineering Handbook, Section 15, Chapter\n8, Irrigation Pumping Plants, should be reviewed\nbefore doing a pump test. Another useful reference is\nUniversity of Nebraska's Revised Irrigation Pumping\nPlant Test Procedure Manual (1985).\n(i) \tEquipment—The equipment needed to test\nirrigation pumps includes:\n• Pressure gauges: one 0 to 100 pounds per square\ninch and one 0 to 200 pounds per square inch.\nLiquid filled or waterproof type is recommended.\n• Flow meter or other method to determine flow\nrate.\n• Collection of miscellaneous fittings used to\ninstall pressure gauges, including pipe thread\ncompound or tape.\n• Vacuum gauge: 0 inch to 30 inches Hg (optional,\nuse to find suction head on suction side of\npump).\n• Electric meter: volts, amps, power factor\n(for electric motors).\n• Hand level and survey rod.\n• Pocket tape (inches and tenths of inches).\n• Two pipe wrenches, two adjustable wrenches.\n• For internal combustion engines:\n— \tPortable propane tank, hose, and fittings,\nand scale for weighing tank (if propane\nengine is analyzed).\n— \tPortable diesel or gasoline tank, hose, and\nfittings, and scale for weighing tank.\n— \tMethod of measuring diesel or gasoline fuel\n(if weighing scales are not used).\n• Watch with stopwatch mode, or stopwatch.\n• Pump manufacturer’s performance curves for\npump(s) being analyzed.\nPumping plant detailed evaluation worksheet.\n• Clipboard and pencil.\nHardware inventory: Obtain the data needed to fill\nout the data sheet by interviewing the operator and by\nobserving equipment name and data plates. (Use name\nplate data with caution as component modification(s)\nmay render data obsolete.)\nSketch the pipeline intake assembly and discharge\nassembly. Show dimensions of component parts. Take\npictures of these assemblies.\nSafety: Use extreme caution when working around\nrunning pumps especially where live drive shafts and\nbelts are exposed. Tie down or remove loose clothing.\nUse a tick meter to check for stray electrical currents.\nIn the absence of a meter, briefly touch equipment\nwith back of hand. If electrical equipment does not\nappear to be properly installed or maintained, do not\nproceed with the evaluation. For personnel safety,\nobserve no smoking when performing pump tests\nwhere internal combustion engines are used.\nThe land user or a mechanic should make electrical\nconnections, measure fuel, and make fuel line connec-\ntions.\n(ii) Data inventory and computations—The\nfollowing steps (example 9–10) are needed to com-\nplete testing of irrigation pumps. The information is\nused in completing the Pumping Plant Detailed Evalu-\nation Worksheet (exhibit 9–10).",

This is the sum of:\n• static head (elevation difference) between the supply water surface and the pump outlet at the point\nwhere pressure is read,\n• friction loss in the suction or riser pipe, and\n• discharge pressure next to the pump. (If the pressure is positive at the pump inlet, as is the case for a\nbooster pump or gravity flow inlet, inlet pressure is subtracted from the discharge pressure.)\nConsideration should be given to operating conditions at times other than the time when the evaluation is\ndone. Fluctuations in the supply water surface or pressure and changes in location and elevation of the\nirrigation outlet during the course of the irrigation should be considered. Worst cases (lowest and highest\nestimated TDH) should be compared to the evaluation TDH and pump performance curves.\n2. \tMeasure flow rate using the best available method. If a propeller flow meter is used, the most\naccurate flow rate is achieved by recording total flow at the beginning and end of a time period, such as a\nhalf hour, and dividing by time. This compensates for fluctuations in flow rate during that period. Flow\nmeters or velocity meters must be installed far enough downstream of elbows, tees, valves, reducers, and\nenlargers to have pipeline velocity flow lines parallel to the pipeline centerline. A distance of at least five\ntimes the pipe diameter is recommended. Vanes installed in the pipeline can be used to help reduce\nturbulence.\n3. \tCompute water horsepower (whp):\nw Flow rate, in gpm \tTDH, in ft\n3960\nhp = ( \t) × ( \t)\n4. \tDetermine energy input:\nElectrical powered units—The easiest method of determining electric energy use is to count the revo-\nlutions of the electric meter disk over a period and calculate kilowatt hours.\nk disk revolutions \tKh\ntime, in sec\nWh PTR \tCTR\n= ( \t) × ( \t) × ( \t) × ( \t) × ( \t)\n( \t)\n3 6\t.\nwhere:\nkWh = kwh/hr = the kilowatt-hours used in 1 hour\nKh \t= a meter constant shown on the meter\nPTR = power transformer ratio, usually equal to 1 (may need to get from power company)\nCTR = current transformer ratio, usually equal to 1 (may need to get from power company)\nAnother way to determine electrical energy use is to measure voltage, amperage, and power factor (if\npower factor meter is available). All legs of 3-phase power must be measured. This takes proper equip-\nment and should only be done by someone with adequate training.

One way is to fill the fuel tank to a known point, then run the\nengine for several hours and then refill the tank to the known point with a measured amount of fuel.\nAnother way is to prepare a 5-gallon fuel can with a fitting and hose just above the bottom. Connect the\nfuel hose to the engine and run it for a short time. Start timing when the pump pressure has come up to\noperating pressure. Weigh the fuel container at the beginning and end of the timing period. Number 2\ndiesel weighs 7.65 pounds per gallon, and gasoline weighs 6.05 pounds per gallon. (Specific weight of\ndiesel and gasoline varies with temperature and type.) Measure or compute gallons per hour used. This is\na dangerous operation and should be done by the operator or someone with experience in working with\ndiesel engines. If air is allowed in the fuel system, diesel fuel injectors can malfunction, requiring a diesel\nspecialty mechanic for repair and adjustments.\nPropane—The volume of fuel used is determined by running the engine for a short period and weighing\nthe fuel used from a portable tank of propane. The tank should be of the type used on recreational ve-\nhicles. Several feet of hose and appropriate connectors are required. This hookup should be done by the\noperator or someone with experience in working with propane engines. Be sure to exhaust air from the\nhose before making carburetor connections. Measure or compute the amount of propane used per hour\nbased on 4.25 pounds of fuel per gallon.\nNatural gas—The most practical procedure for determining natural gas use is to run the pump at oper-\nating load for several hours. Read the gas meter at the beginning and end of the test to determine the\nnumber of thousand cubic feet used. Measure the evaluation time in hours and hundredths of hours.\n5. \tCompare the pumping plant energy usage to energy use by a well designed and operated pump-\ning plant to measure whether improvements in the plant are warranted. For this purpose we use\na set of standards developed at the University of Nebraska. Nebraska Pump Standards are shown on the\nworksheet. If the comparison comes out close to or more than 100 percent, then the pumping plant (the\ncombined power unit and pump) is considered satisfactory. If the comparison comes out significantly\nbelow 100 percent, then consideration should be given to identifying and making pumping plant changes\nto improve operation.\nPerformance of the pumping plant, including power unit and pump, can be determined as follows:\n% of pumping plant performance criteria 100\nenergy input \tpower plant criteria in whp - h/unit\n= ( \t) × ( \t)\n( \t) × ( \t)\nwhp\nwhere energy input is in terms of kW for electricity; gallons per hour for diesel, gasoline, and propane;\nand meters per cubit foot per hour for natural gas.\nThis criterion is based on 75 percent pump and 88 percent electric motor efficiency as a standard.

The pump\ndischarge pipeline should expand to full diameter\nupstream of valves and fittings. Consult pump\nmanufacturer’s data for proper installation proce-\ndures.\nStep 2—If sizes of pump inlet and discharge piping or\nfittings appear small, calculate friction loss and make\na judgment as to whether changes should be recom-\nmended. An eccentric reducer with the flat side up\nshould be used (where needed) to reduce the suction\npipeline diameter to the inlet diameter at the pump.\nThe inlet fitting at the pump should be the high point\non the suction piping. Pump inlet and outlet diameters\nare based on pump design, not pipeline design. Gener-\nally, velocities in suction piping and discharge piping\nshould be less than 5 feet per second.\nStep 3—Compare the results with the design.\n(iv) Recommendations\nDiscuss evaluation conclusions with the operator.\nMake recommendations based on observations, fac-\ntual measurements, and experience. The data assist\nthe operator in determining if changes are economi-\ncally desirable. Use the data in completing cost saving\ncomputations in a complete irrigation system analysis.\nLeave sufficient written documentation for operators\nto review, study, and make a decision, and to provide\nto a pump dealer if desired.\n(v) \tGeneral pumping problems\nLack of maintenance is by far the greatest pumping\nproblem. Pumps, valves, fittings, and other parts wear\nwith use. When pumping efficiency drops more than 5\npercent, maintenance needs to be performed and worn\nparts replaced. Excess wear in the wear ring around\nthe eye of the impeller is a major cause of reduced\npump efficiency. Removing a few bolts and using a\nmicrometer can determine when replacement or\nrebuilding is needed. Air leaks in the suction piping is\nanother major cause of pumping problems.\nA practical maximum suction lift for most pumps is\nabout 15 feet at sea level. This is because of high\nvelocities in the suction pipeline and fittings and at the\npump impeller entrance. Depending on pump eleva-\ntion above sea level and hydraulic entrance conditions\nat the pump, cavitation can start to occur at about 8\nfeet of suction lift. Cavitation sounds like small gravel\nmoving with the water through the pump. It is actually\nair bubbles in the water collapsing as a result of nega-\ntive pressure. Excessive negative pressure accelerates\nmetal erosion in the eye of the impeller and on the\nbackside of impeller blades. Air leaks, primarily from\nfittings and welds, in the suction pipeline also cause a\nform of cavitation. Cavitation reduces pumping equip-\nment efficiency and useful life.\nAn overheated motor or engine is an indication of\nexcess load. An electric motor should be warm, but\nnot hot to the touch.

Centrifugal pump impellers can be trimmed to\nreduce discharge pressure without significantly reduc-\ning discharge flow. Reducing impeller rotations per\nminute (rpm) reduces pressure and discharge flow.\nClosing a valve on the pump discharge to reduce\npressure does little to reduce energy required at the\npump.\n(vi) Changing pump performance characteris-\ntics—If the current pump performance characteristics\nare known, the effects of a change in diameter of\nimpeller or pump rpm on performance characteristics\ncan be estimated using a set of equations known as\naffinity laws.\nWith constant rpm impeller and varying impeller\ndiameter:\n• Capacity varies directly with the impeller\ndiameter.\n• Head varies as the square of the impeller\ndiameter.\n• Horsepower varies as the cube of the impeller\ndiameter.\nWith constant impeller diameter and varying pump\nrpm:\n• Pump capacity varies directly with rpm.\n• Head varies as the square of the rpm.\n• Horsepower input varies as the cube of the rpm.",

However, under certain conditions and with\nhigher bhp motors, use of a variable frequency drive\n(VFD) may be an economical option. Cost of installing\na VFD versus reduced energy use must be analyzed.\nVFD’s allow the rpm of the AC electric motor to be\nreduced by varying the frequency of the power into the\nmotor, which in turn reduces the horsepower demand.\nThe drives consist of a converter that changes AC\npower to DC power and an inverter that changes the\nDC power into adjustable frequency AC power. As the\nfrequency of the power is decreased, the power to the\nmotor and the motor rpm are both reduced. This\ndecrease in motor rpm can substantially reduce the\npump horsepower demand, since the pump horse-\npower demand is proportional to the pump rpm. The\nresult is that a small change in rpm causes a significant\nchange in pump horsepower demand.

Water\nintake rate of soil is the most important item to be\nconsidered in the design of a surface irrigation system,\nand it is the most variable. Soil intake rate is also\nimportant for other irrigation methods. The two pur-\nposes for making soil intake or maximum application\nrate evaluations are to:\n• Aid in placing a named kind of soil or group of\nsoils in an intake characteristic (family or group)\nfor future designs.\n• Determine the intake characteristics for a spe-\ncific condition on an individual field.\nTable 2–6, Chapter 2, Soils, displays estimates of soil\nintake characteristics (for basin, border, and furrow\nsurface irrigation) and maximum average application\nrate (for sprinkle irrigation). These estimates are made\nby interpretation of data taken from either actual field\ntests or estimating intake characteristics using surface\nsoil texture by soil series. Intake characteristic\ncurves (intake family curves) are unitless. It is\nimproper to use any unit, such as inches per\nhour. The 1.0 intake family curve does not express an\ninfiltration process averaging 1 inch per hour.\nIn the past, surface irrigation was the predominant\nirrigation method used to apply water to the land. Soil\nintake families were an attempt to group soils with\nsimilar intake characteristics for easier data manipula-\ntion and fewer digits to handle on a slide rule. Later\nresearch and field experience indicated soils were\nmore variable and the infiltration process more com-\nplex than originally anticipated. In addition to soil\nsurface texture, soil structure, density, organic matter\ncontent, subsurface texture, macro pores, and general\nsoil condition are known to affect the infiltration\nprocess.\nAt least 30 percent of irrigated soils do not follow what\nwas thought to be Standard Intake Curves. Especially\nwith well graded, low organic matter soils, intake\ncurves tend to concave downward instead of upward.",

Although\nnot technically correct, in practice a specific gross\napplication depth and elapsed time are selected and\nthe standard intake family curve nearest that point is\nused. If a different gross depth of application is se-\nlected, a new standard intake curve must be selected\nto represent that condition. Field measurements and a\nplotting of a revised accumulated intake versus time\ncurve would work better.\nEach irrigation method and system provides its own\nunique water infiltration process (fig. 9–31). Therefore,\ndetermining soil intake characteristics or application\nrate also must be unique.\nBasin and border irrigation have a near uniform depth\nof free water on the soil surface, which creates a small\nhydraulic head (pressure) to force water into the soil.\nWater movement through the soil is primarily down-\nward, first by gravity, then as depth increases by\ncapillary action. With furrows (or corrugations) free\nwater is located in open channels and typically does\nnot cover plant beds. Flow from the furrow is down-\nward (gravitational forces) laterally and even upward\ninto plant rows (capillary forces). Thus, border intake\ncharacteristic (family) curves and furrow intake char-\nacteristic (family) curves are different.\nWith sprinkle irrigation (and precipitation), water\nmovement into and through the soil is primarily down-\nward (gravitational and capillary forces). Like border\nirrigation, the entire soil surface is wetted. However,\nunlike border irrigation, the small hydraulic head\n(pressure) on the soil surface does not exist with\nsprinkle irrigation. If it does, water translocation and\nrunoff typically occur. Average maximum application\nrate is used for sprinkle irrigation.\nLarge volume short duration applications made with\nmost low pressure in-canopy application systems\nrequire small basins or reservoirs, in-row ripping,\nresidue, or other soil management techniques to limit\nwater translocation and runoff.\nMany field tests must be made to determine reliable\naverages for each soil series. Many factors affect water\ninfiltration. Among them are soil texture, soil condi-\ntion and recent cultivations, macro pore presence,\norganic matter content in the surface layer, tillage\nequipment compaction layers, soil-water content at\ntime of irrigation, and quality of irrigation water as it\naffects intake (suspended sediment, electrical conduc-\ntivity [EC], sodium absorption ratio [SAR], and tem-\nperature). See Chapter 13, Quality of Water Supply, for\nadditional information.\nFurthermore, intake characteristics of a given soil\nseries vary with location, field, irrigation event, and\nseason. Intake characteristics for furrow irrigation\nchange as the crop growing season progresses. These\nchanges are a result of compaction by cultivation\nequipment, heavy equipment compaction in furrows,\nworm activity, sediment in irrigation water, soil con-\nsolidation, erosion, sedimentation, and water tempera-\nture. Intake characteristics for border irrigation sys-\ntems with perennial crops can decrease as a result of\nthe operation of harvest equipment on moist soils.\nUnder sprinkler systems having medium to large\ndroplet sizes, intake rates can decrease because of\npuddling and compaction of bare soil surface and\nsurface sealing from displaced fine soil particles. After\nthe designer selects an intake rate or maximum sprin-\nkler application rate from the irrigation guide, onsite\ninvestigations (followup) should be made to check\nactual field condition soil characteristics that affect\ndesign parameters selected.\n(b) Surface irrigation systems\nintake\nWhen providing an analysis of an existing surface\nirrigation system operation using actual field data\n(inflow, advance), computer software programs, such\nas Agricultural Research Service’s SRFR program, can\nprovide realistic results. This model uses the kine-\nmatic wave and zero-inertia theory, which more nearly\nsimulates actual field flow conditions. The soil infiltra-\ntion conditions significantly influence the achievable\ndistribution uniformity. The relationship between\ncumulative infiltrated depth and infiltration opportu-\nnity time can be described by a number of empirical\nexpressions. The most common expressions are\nvariations of the power function shown in equation\nform. This equation is used in computer programs for\nsimulating surface irrigation.\nZ = \t+ \t+\tk t \tB \tC\ta \tt\nwhere:\nZ \t= cumulative infiltration\nt \t= infiltration opportunity time\na \t= empirical exponent\nk, B, & C = empirical constants",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–188 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nFor design of border irrigation systems or to validate\nan intake family using known field advance and oppor-\ntunity times for a border system, the concept of intake\nfamily is described in NEH, section 15, chapter 4, by\nthe equation (NRCS modified Kostiakov equation), as\nfollows:\nZ = k t a + C\nwhere:\nZ \t= cumulative infiltration\nt \t= infiltration opportunity time\na \t= empirical exponent\nk & C = empirical constants\n(1) Border and basin irrigation systems\nWhen an irrigation takes place for either level or\ngraded border systems, water is ponded on the surface\nof the soil with water infiltrating vertically downward\ninto the soil. See figure 9–31. The process to determine\nsoil intake characteristics for borders or basins must\nbe similar. A process using a series of cylinders (short\nlengths of steel pipe driven into the ground) has been\ndeveloped. They are referred to as cylinder infiltro-\nmeters.\nCylinder infiltrometers are installed with buffer rings\n(or diked earth) around each cylinder to help maintain\nnear vertical water movement. For the intake test,\nwater is ponded in the cylinders and buffer rings to a\ndepth slightly greater than the normal depth of irriga-\ntion water flow. Depth of water should be maintained\nwithin 20 percent of the normal flow depth. The rate of\nwater level drop is measured in the inside of the\ncylinder(s) and recorded. With basin irrigation, the\nentire irrigation set can be used as an infiltrometer.\nData are plotted to display cumulative infiltration in\ninches versus time. The plotted curve is then com-\npared to a standard set of border intake-family curves\nto determine the average border intake family for the\nspecific soil at that specific site. See figure 2–3, Chap-\nter 2, Soils, and NEH, Part 623, Chapter 4, Border\nIrrigation.\n(2) Furrow irrigation systems\nWhen an irrigation takes place for either level or\ngraded furrow systems, water within the furrow infil-\ntrates vertically downward, laterally, and diagonally\nupward into the furrow bed because of soil water\ntension differential. See figure 9–31. Methods devel-\noped to determine soil intake characteristics for\nfurrows need to simulate the actual irrigation process.\nTypical furrow conditions needed for determining\nintake characteristics would include:\n• Water flowing in the furrow at a rate and depth\nsimilar to a normal irrigation,\n• Water flowing at the soil water content when an\nirrigation is needed, and\n• Water flowing in a wheel and nonwheel row or\nrecently cultivated or noncultivated furrow.\nThe three methods developed to determine infiltration\ncharacteristics for furrow irrigation are the furrow\ninflow-outflow, flowing furrow infiltrometer, and the\nfurrow stream-rate of advance methods. Only the\nflowing furrow infiltrometer and the furrow stream-\nrate of advance methods will be described fully in this\nchapter.\n(i) \tFurrow inflow-outflow method—This method\nis described in NEH, Part 623, Chapter 5, Furrow\nIrrigation. When the furrow inflow-outflow method is\nused, furrow flow rate measuring flumes, weirs, or\norifice plates are placed at the head end and lower end\nof the furrow. The actual irrigation is used for a water\nsupply. Infiltration characteristics of enough furrows\n(typically four or more) should be measured to be\nrepresentative of the field. Buffer furrows on each side\nof test furrow should be used.\n(ii) Flowing furrow infiltrometer method—This\nmethod was designed by the ARS Water Conservation\nLab in Phoenix, Arizona. With the flowing furrow\ninfiltrometer, an auxiliary water supply in a vertical\nsided container and a return flow pump are needed.\nAfter a furrow section (typically 10 meters or 33 feet)\nis selected, a float controlled water sump with pump is\nplaced at the lower end of the furrow. A flow measur-\ning flume with return hose (from the downstream\nsump pump) and valve is installed at the upper end of\nthe furrow section.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–189\t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nTo begin the furrow intake characteristic test, water\nfrom the auxiliary supply reservoir is discharged into\nthe downstream pump sump via the float controlled\nvalve. The return flow pump then transfers the water\nto the upstream sump and flume via the return hose,\nwhere the flow rate is both controlled and measured.\nA constant flow rate is maintained in the furrow, with\nwater lost by infiltration coming from the auxiliary\nreservoir via the float control valve in the downstream\npump sump. Water surface elevation in the auxiliary\nreservoir versus time is recorded as soon as the fur-\nrow flow rate stabilizes, generally within 5 minutes.\nFurrow flow rate and soil infiltration volume deter-\nmine the necessary capacity of the flowing furrow\ninfiltrometer.\n(iii) Furrow stream-rate of advance method—\nWhen this method is used, the furrow inflow stream is\nheld constant and the rate of advance measured. The\ngross application calculated at the time water reaches\neach station (based on an area equal to the furrow\nspacing times length of advance) is plotted on log-log\npaper versus time of advance. An average cumulative\nintake curve results. This procedure assumes all water\nhas been infiltrated into the soil. Thus, the test section\nmust be long enough where surface storage is a small\npercentage of water infiltrated. Initial points plot as a\ncurve on log-log paper. As the volume of water in\nsurface storage becomes a smaller percentage of total\nwater applied, the curve straightens. The straight line\nportion represents the accumulative intake curve.\nEach method has its own unique field equipment and\ndata collection process even though they provide a\nsimilar intake characteristic curve. Data are plotted to\ndisplay cumulative infiltration in inches versus time.\nThe plotted curve can be matched to a standard set of\nfurrow intake-family curves to determine furrow\nintake family for that particular soil type. See figure\n2–4, Chapter 2, Soils, and NEH, Section 15, Chapter 5,\nFurrow Irrigation.\n(c) Sprinkle irrigation systems\nRotating impact type sprinkler heads apply water to\nthe soil surface intermittently as the jet from the\nnozzle rotates around a riser. Spray type heads apply\nwater to the soil surface continually. Water infiltrates\nvertically downward. See figure 9–31. Continuous\n(self) moving systems use either rotating impact type\nheads, rotating spray heads, or continuous spray\nheads. A continuous moving lateral provides an in-\ncreasing and decreasing application rate pattern\n(assumed elliptical pattern) on a specific spot; as the\nlateral approaches, centers over, and moves past a\nspecific spot on the soil surface. Short duration appli-\ncation rates on quarter mile center pivot laterals that\nhave low pressure spray heads can be very high (up to\n12 inches per hour). Low Energy Precision Application\n(LEPA) and Low Pressure In-Canopy (LPIC) systems\nuse very narrow spray pattern discharge devices, thus\nproviding extremely high, short duration application\nrates (up to 30 inches per hour). All require different\nprocesses to determine soil intake characteristics even\nthough a maximum sprinkler application rate is the net\nresult.\nRegardless of the sprinkler application process, deter-\nmining the maximum allowable application rate is a\nvisual observation process. When application rate\nexceeds soil intake rate, ponding or runoff occurs. The\nspot or area of soil along the lateral where ponding is\nbeginning to occur and runoff or translocation is just\nstarting represents the area receiving the maximum\nallowable soil application rate. Ponding is generally\nnot a good indicator by itself, since surface storage\ncan contain an excessive application until sufficient\ntime has elapsed to allow the ponded water to infil-\ntrate. However with most sprinkler systems, some soil\nsurface storage must be available. A small amount of\nwind can distort application patterns. Typically wind\nspeed is not uniform; therefore, the test should be\ndone during a no-wind condition.\nThe best judgment of maximum soil infiltration rate\ncan be made by watching the sheen of reflected light\non the soil surface as water is applied. With rotating\nimpact sprinklers, the sheen should have just disap-\npeared before the next sprinkler rotation. With spray\nheads, watch for micro runoff and ponding. Typically\nmany tests are needed on any one soil series because\nof the small areas that are tested.",

Pair, ARS, published in\nAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineering,\n44(12):672-673: Dec. 1963, and Transactions of the\nASAE 9(3): 359-363: 1966. The Tovey Meter has a\nrotating impact type sprinkler head mounted inside a\nvertically mounted barrel having a vertical narrow\ndischarge slot on one side. The slot allows the sprin-\nkler head to discharge onto an area of about one-tenth\nof a full circle, thus conserving water and providing a\ndry area to work from. Water is supplied by a portable\nwater tank. Size of the sprinkler head nozzle (dis-\ncharge) is increased to where a range of application\nrates in the wetted pattern from below to above the\nmaximum application rate can be observed. A set of\ncatch containers is placed at some evenly spaced\ndistances from the sprinkler head. Observations are\nmade as to whether the application rate is under, equal\nto, or exceeds the soil maximum application rate.\nCatch rates are then measured in the containers in the\ndesired area observed.\nMore recently, an application device and process have\nbeen developed by Michigan State University (MSU).\nThe MSU infiltrometer is a light truss supported pipe-\nline from which several water application devices can\nbe suspended. The pipeline is supported on each end\nby A-frame style electrical conduit pipe supports. An\nauxiliary water supply with pump is generally used.\nSpray heads are typically used in this device. Several\nsizes of sprinkler or spray heads can provide a range\nof low-to-excessive application rates for the soil being\ntested. Sprinkler heads are cycled on and off at differ-\nent frequencies to vary water application rate. A video\nis available from NRCS showing the use of the MSU\ninfiltrometer.\nExisting sprinkler systems can also be used. Larger\nthan normal discharge sprinkler heads are temporarily\ninstalled on two adjacent risers on a lateral. Odd\nshaped areas somewhere in the sprinkler pattern will\nvisually display ranges of low-to-excessive application\nrates for the soil and site being tested. Before system\nstartup, valves are placed at least on two adjacent\nsprinkler heads to allow changing of nozzles without\ninterrupting the balance of the irrigation lateral.\nExisting systems are used for continuous moving\ncenter pivot and linear laterals. Excessive application\nrates occur somewhere along the lateral, typically in\nthe outer quarter to one-third of the center pivot\nlateral. This is especially true on medium to fine tex-\ntured soils. Continuous recording catch devices are\nalmost essential to record the increasing and decreas-\ning application rates of a moving lateral. This also is\nthe only way to realistically record an accurate short\nduration maximum application rate. Where simple\ncatch devices are used, only an average rate for the\ntotal irrigation set (lateral pass) is obtained. A method\nusing five catch containers set perpendicular to the\nlateral can be used to approximate maximum applica-\ntion rate. The containers are kept covered until the\nlateral is over the first container. The cover is removed\nand timing is started. An elliptical shape application\npattern is used to approximate maximum application\nrate when compared to average application rate (maxi-\nmum rate = about 1.5 x average rate). See section\n652.0905(g)(iii), Continuous/self move sprinkler, field\nprocedure step 9 for a process to measure maximum\nsoil application rate.\n(d) Infiltration and application\nrate test procedures\n(1) Border and basin\nA brief description of manual procedures is presented\nin this part.

Replicated infiltrometer\nmeasurements on a few typical extensive kind of soil\nprovide more reliable information than single mea-\nsurements on a large number of soil types. With coarse\nto medium textured soils on readily accessible sites,\ntwo people can reasonably run two tests in 1 day. With\nmedium to fine textured soil and slow intake rates,\nonly one test can be reasonably run in a day.\nMeasurements made on five kinds of soil for each land\nresource area at carefully selected model sites for\neach soil are suggested. Three to five cylinder\ninfiltrometers should be used at each site. Test data\nfrom one infiltrometer is often extreme compared to\nthe others and is not used. Doing fewer select soils\nand sites should provide a basis for estimating intake\nrates for closely related soils.\nA soil scientist should identify and correlate soil series\nand surface texture at each site. The sites should\nrepresent average soil conditions for the soil series.\nFor each test site, identify and record distances to\nfield edges or other permanent features near the site.\nSee figure 9–33 for example soil description for test\nsite.\n(iii) Performing tests—Tests are performed using\nthe following procedure:\nStep 1—Carefully drive rings into the soil keeping\nthem vertical as possible. Avoid obvious rodent holes,\nrotted roots, and cracks. The soil should be reasonably\nmoist to provide ease of driving and to provide a good\nseal between soil and infiltrometer walls. Identify rings\nand reference the point on each ring where hook\ngauge is to be located. Install outside buffer rings,\nearth dikes, or use the entire basin as a buffer.\nStep 2—Have a supply of water readily available for\nquick filling of buckets. Open 55-gallon barrels are\nconvenient to use. Have buckets full of water ready to\nput into infiltrometers. Have hook gauge, scale, and\nforms located at the measuring location in the\ninfiltrometer ready to measure and record water level.\nAccount for rapidly infiltrating water early in the test,\nespecially with coarse textured soil where a significant\namount of the irrigation can infiltrate in the first few\nminutes. Also, with some deep cracking fine textured\nsoil, the initial intake can be high and dramatically\nslow after the cracks are filled and the soil particles\nswell. Worm activity can cause high initial intake\nbecause of preferential flow paths.\nStep 3—Place the burlap over soil in the infiltrometers\nand pour water into infiltrometers. Record hook gauge\nreadings and time. Infiltrometers should be started at\nsuccessive 1-minute increments, if practical. This gives\nan opportunity to observe the first 5-minute reading\nfor each infiltrometer in succession. For high intake\nrate soil, water may need to be added before the first 5\nminutes passes. As water is added to maintain near\nconstant levels, hook gauge readings must be made\nbefore and after water is added. Times of water addi-\ntion need not be recorded if they fall between regular\nreading times. If buffer rings are used, water must be\nmaintained in them also, but measurements need not\nbe recorded. With level basin irrigation systems, the\nflooded basin can be used as a buffer ring.\nStep 4—The first 5 to 10 minutes can be rather frantic\non moderately high to high intake rate soil. Record all\ndata on form NRCS-ENG-322. Figure 9–34 is example\nfield data recorded on this form. When readings are\ntaken on the suggested elapsed time intervals as\nindicated on the form, calculations and plotting are\nsimplified. Soil condition, past cropping history, and\ntillage practices used by the farmer may be significant\nin interpreting results.\nStep 5—A complete test requires nearly 4 hours of\nactual running time. Testing low to very low intake\nrate soil takes longer, and high intake rate soil can\ntake as little as 1 to 2 hours. When accumulated intake\nis about 6 to 8 inches, the test can be stopped. Erratic\ndata from one or more infiltrometers at a site should\nbe discarded. On low intake soil, a complete test that\nallows a full irrigation may take 24 hours to complete.\nQuite often an intake test can be performed for an\ninitial period of 3 to 4 hours, then by plotting on log-\nlog paper and extending the accumulated intake\nversus time line, infiltration for latter parts of an\nirrigation is represented. If the line extension is within\n10 percent of actual infiltration, performing long\nduration tests is not justified. Reduced test time is\nmore practical, especially when soil variability is\nconsidered.",

See example data and the\nresulting plot in figure 9–35. Draw best fit curve\n(straight line on log-log paper) through the plotted\npoints (use 2 x 3 cycle logarithmic paper). Many soils\nmatch the standard curves. For those not matching, a\nregression analysis can be made to develop an equa-\ntion for the curve or line. Compare to figure 9–36 for\nintake families for border irrigation design. Determine\naccumulated intake for the curve:\nAccumulated Intake = \t×\tc \tt n\nwhere:\nc = y intercept at t = 1 minute\nn = linear slope of line\nFrom the plotted line: Using an engineer's scale, deter-\nmine slope of line (n).

Only one person would need to visit the test\nsite periodically during the infiltration test after initial\nstartup. The basic testing process and time of test are\nthe same regardless. Five sets of equipment are\nneeded except one data logger can handle water level\ndata from all five cylinder infiltrometers.\nWater level automation within buffer rings or dikes is\nsimple. A water supply barrel, large diameter garden\nhose, and a float controlled valve can eliminate the\nneed for manually adding water to buffer rings. Float\ncontrolled valves should be mounted on a durable\nstake where each valve can be raised or lowered to\nadjust the buffer ring water surface at each site.\nFigure 9–35 \tExample cylinder infiltrometer test data accumulated intake for border irrigation design\n10.04 5 6 7 8 10 \t20 \t30 40 \t60 \t80 100 \t200 \t300 400 \t600 \t1,000\n4 5 6 7 8 10 \t20 \t30 40 \t60 \t80 100 \t200 \t300 400 \t600 \t1,000\n8.0\n6.0\n5.0\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n.8\n.6\n.4\n.3\n.2\n10.0\n8.0\n6.0\n5.0\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n.8\n.6\n.4\n.3\n.2\nTime in minutes\nAccumulated intake (in)\nSoil-water intake curves\nLand user ____________________\nDate ________________________\nField office ___________________\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n4\nJoe Example\n7-24-84\nBillings\n2\n1\n5 3",

Refer to NEH Section 15,\nChapter 5, Furrow Irrigation, for additional informa-\ntion on inflow-outflow method of furrow intake deter-\nmination.\n(i) \tEquipment—Equipment needs for furrow\ninflow-outflow method include:\n• Portable water flow measuring devices for deter-\nmining inflow and outflow in each furrow (small\nbroadcrested v-notch or trapezoidal flumes, v-\nnotch weirs, or orifice plates). Water surface in\nfurrow should not be raised above normal flow\nconditions by the measuring device.\n• Auger, push type sampler, probe, shovel.\n• 100-foot tape, lath, or wire flags.\n• Level and rod to determine elevations at 100-foot\nstations down the length of the test furrows.\n• Pocket tape and straight edge to measure furrow\ncross sections at two or three stations.\n(ii) Site selection—Carefully preselect sites in\nadvance for specific soil series, soil surface textures,\nand crop. Replicated measurements on a few typical\nsoil series and surface textures provide more reliable\ninformation than single measurements on a large\nnumber of soils. On medium to high intake rate soil,\ntwo people can reasonably run one test in 1 day. On\nlow intake soil, it may take 24 hours for a complete\ntest that allows a full irrigation. Quite often a furrow\nintake test can be performed for an initial period of\n3 to 4 hours, then by plotting on log-log paper and\nextending the accumulated intake versus time line,\ninfiltration for latter parts of an irrigation is repre-\nsented. If the line extension is within 10 percent of\nactual infiltration, performing long duration tests is\nnot justified.\nMeasurements made on predominant soil series and\nsurface textures for each land resource area at care-\nfully selected model sites for each soil are suggested.\nAlso, replicated measurements on a few typical domi-\nnant soils provide more reliable information than a\nsingle measurement on a large number of soils. The\ndata can be projected to other close related soils.\nA soil scientist should identify the soil series and\nsurface texture at each furrow evaluation site. (Soil\nmap units may contain inclusions.) Because of the\ninclusions or local soil series changes in the field, the\ntest length generally is some portion of the full furrow\nlength (50 to 200 feet recommended). Most testing is\nto identify infiltration characteristics for a soil series\nand surface texture, thus that soil series and texture\nshould be measured. Sites should represent average\nsoil conditions for the soil series and surface texture\ntested. Identify test site with reference to field edges\nor other permanent features in or near the field.\nIf field (instead of soil series and surface texture)\ninfiltration characteristics are desired, measure the\nnumber of furrows and furrow length that best repre-\nsents field conditions. Values obtained are good for\nthat field and may represent field conditions for simi-\nlar conditions and soil series.\n(iii) Performing tests—Tests are performed using\nthe following procedure:\nStep 1—Set stakes or wire flags at 100-foot stations\n(use measuring tape), determine elevation at each\nstation (use level and rod), and measure furrow cross\nsections at two or three stations (use pocket tape and\nstraight edge). A uniform grade for the furrow length is\ndesirable. The full furrow length does not need to be\nused; any length will work. The minimum evaluation\nlength should be 50 to 100 feet for high intake rate soil\nand 100 to 200 feet for low intake rate soil. (The\nevaluator’s ability to determine flow rate at each end\nof the furrow test section determines length.)\nStep 2—Three adjacent furrows should be evaluated.\nAdjacent furrows on each side of the test area should\nalso be irrigated simultaneously. This requires observ-\ners to walk either on top of the beds or in the adjacent\nirrigated furrows themselves. Use the same inflow\nstream size that the irrigator uses. However, the flow\nshould be large enough to produce a fairly uniform\nrate of advance through the test section.\nStart flow into furrows, record time, adjust streams so\nthat flows into all test furrows are about equal. For\nadvance rate data, record the time water in each\nfurrow reaches each station. Two people are essential\nto perform tests where inflow rates are high or the soil\nprovides fast advance rates. Periodically check water\ninflow rate and record time of readings. Inflow should\nbe constant during the test. Record time water starts\nto flow through the outflow measuring device. Periodi-\ncally measure and record time for outflow.",

It decreases after\ninflow shut-off and recession starts. Record time of\ninflow shut-off. Continue to periodically measure\noutflow and record times until flow stops. If ending\nthe intake evaluation before completion of a full\nirrigation, take final inflow-outflow readings at the\nsame time. The full irrigation time does not need to be\nused. The test should run sufficiently long for the\noutflow to become constant for at least 3 to 4 hours.\nThis indicates infiltration is at a constant rate.\nStep 3—Computation and evaluation procedures are\ndescribed in NEH, Section 15, Chapter 5, Furrow\nIrrigation. Example of data collected from a field\nintake test are displayed in figures 5–23 to 5–28. The\ncumulative intake and associated opportunity time are\nplotted on log-log paper (fig. 9–37). This information\ndefines the measured intake curve. This curve is then\ncompared to standard intake-family curves in figure\n9–38 to determine the most representative intake\nfamily. Example displayed indicates intake family for\nexisting site condition, If = 0.5. Appropriate values of a\nand b are selected. Graded furrow detail evaluation\nprocedure and example forms are described in section\n652.0905(g)(3).\nStep 4—Although not needed for the intake test,\nmeasuring the wetted bulb is desirable about 24 hours\nafter the irrigation is completed. A probe or push type\ncore sampler can be used to define the boundary line\nbetween wet and dry soil. Another method is to exca-\nvate a trench perpendicular across the furrow and\nobserve and measure the wetted area. The soil mois-\nture (after 24 hours) immediately below the furrow is\ngenerally considered to be field capacity (in medium\nto fine texture soil).\nOften a previously irrigated set with the same soil\nseries and surface texture is used for this purpose.\nCheck wetted depth at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 percent\nof the furrow length for distribution uniformity and\nadequacy of irrigation, if test is of equal duration to a\nregular irrigation. Observe root development location\nand pattern for a better understanding of the actual\nplant root zone.",

Cross sec-\ntional area of the water supply tank should be such\nthat the water surface elevation drops at least 2 feet\nduring the test.\n(ii) Site selection—Carefully preselect sites in\nadvance for specific soil series and surface texture.\nFurrows are tested individually. Two people can\nreasonably run tests at two nearby sites in 1 day for\nmedium to high intake rate soil.\nMeasurements made on predominant soil series and\nsurface textures for each land resource area at care-\nfully select model sites for each soil are suggested.\nAlso, replicated measurements on a few typical domi-\nnant soils provide more reliable information than\nsingle measurements on a large number of soils. The\ndata can be projected to other close related soils.\nA soil scientist should identify soils series and surface\ntextures at each test site. Each test site is relatively\nsmall (30- to 100-foot furrow length) to avoid soil\ninclusions and have a sufficient water supply. Identify\ntest site with reference to field edges and local fea-\ntures.\n(iii) Performing tests—With water from a water\nsupply tank, start flow into the downstream furrow\nsump via the hose and float controlled valve. Water is\nimmediately pumped (returned) to the upstream sump\nand measuring device where furrow inflow rate is\nadjusted with a value to the planned furrow flow rate\nor flow rate used by the irrigator. A near study water\nflow rate into the furrow and a constant furrow water\nstorage volume should be obtained within about 5\nminutes. Record the supply tank water surface eleva-\ntion to start the test. Water lost by infiltration during\nthe test is made up with new water from the water\nsupply tank via hose and float control valve at the\ndownstream pump sump.\nWater surface elevation (or stage) in the water supply\ntank versus time is recorded about every 10 minutes.\nAlthough automated data recording may be available,\nmanual recording is generally adequate. After initial\nset up, one operator should remain at the site through-\nout the test.\nTypically, tests can be discontinued after 3 to 4 hours.\nIf the plotted accumulated intake versus opportunity\ntime can be extended for longer set times within about\n10 percent of actual, conducting longer tests is not\njustified. Soils generally are more variable than addi-\ntional accuracy obtained by running longer tests.\nAll data can be measured with small flumes or cali-\nbrated cans, pressure transducers, or strip gauges, and\nrecorded using data loggers.\n(iv) Calculations—With the cross sectional area of\nthe vertical sided water supply tank known, the vol-\nume of water (in acre-inches) applied to the test area\n(furrow length times the furrow spacing) can be calcu-\nlated. Accumulated furrow infiltration in acre-inches\nversus elapsed (opportunity) time can be plotted on\nlog-log paper. Infiltration during the first 15 minutes to\n1 hour can be significant when irrigating high intake,\ncracking or loose soil.\nA composite curve for tests performed on the same\nsoil series and surface texture can be plotted manually\nor a best fit curve can be calculated using all plotted\npoints.\nAdditional water measurement detail is presented in\nsection 652.0907.",

Additional details de-\npending on method used and type of application or\ninfiltration test device are described in section\n652.0907.\n(i) \tPeriodic move or set type sprinkler\nEquipment needed:\n• Catch containers or rain gauges.\n• 100- to 250-milliliter graduated cylinder.\n• Measuring tape, watch, recording forms.\n• Stakes, rubber bands, or similar way to support\ncatch containers or rain gauges above crop\ncanopy.\n• Miscellaneous sprinkler nozzles or spray heads\nand tools.\n• Operating sprinkler lateral or sprinkler\ninfiltrometer. When using an operating sprinkler\nlateral, first obtain permission to change sprin-\nkler nozzles (and heads if necessary). Before\nperforming the infiltration test, install valves\n(ball type preferred) in sprinkler head risers\nwhere nozzles and or heads may be changed.\nValves in adjacent risers help to minimize getting\nwet.\n• Sprinkler infiltrometer test device. The test\ndevice need only wet a small portion of a full\ncircle so operators and observers are working on\ndry soil. A collection system is necessary to\ncatch and recirculate water from the sprinkler or\nspray head area when it is not discharging water\nonto the soil surface. Sharp edged and vertical\nsided containers work; however, 4-inch or larger\ndiameter sharp edged catch containers are pre-\nferred as they can more accurately catch precipi-\ntation. If containers are not vertical sided, the\ncatch must be measured volumetrically and\nconverted to depth in inches based on the open\narea at top of container. With some nozzle trajec-\ntory patterns, such as low angle sprinkler heads\non short risers, water droplets are moving more\nhorizontal than vertical. This type of sprinkler\nhead presents a challenge, so the results are\nmeaningful.\nSite selection:\nCarefully preselect sites in advance for specific soil\nseries, surface textures, and crop. Replicated measure-\nments (3 to 5) on a few typical extensive soils provide\nmore reliable information than do a single measure-\nment on a large number of soils. Two people can\nreasonably run two tests in 1 day if sites are close\ntogether and a water supply is relative accessible.\nMeasurements made on predominant soil series and\nsurface textures for each land resource area at care-\nfully select model sites for each soil are suggested.\nAlso, replicated measurements on a few typical domi-\nnant soils provide more reliable information than a\nsingle measurement on a large number of soils. The\ndata can be projected to other close related soils.\nA soil scientist should identify and correlate soils\nseries and surface texture at each test site. Because a\ntest site is relatively small, inclusions in the field are\ngenerally not a problem. However, actual surface\ntexture at the site needs to be known. Identify test site\nwith reference to field edges and local features.\nDescribe soil surface conditions, such as surface\norganic debris, surface storage, soil condition, cultiva-\ntion practices, and crop condition.\nPerforming tests:\nUse the following procedure to measure maximum\nallowable sprinkler application rate:\nStep 1—Catch containers are set in the wetted pattern\nin groups of three (suggested at 5-foot intervals). Care\nmust be taken to avoid foot traffic in the area around\neach catch container where infiltration is observed.\nThe observer must be able to see bare soil around\neach catch container. The maximum application rate\ntypically occurs when soil has become wet and the\ninitial high intake rate has passed. To pre-wet the site\nbefore the test is run may be necessary unless a full\nrange of under-to-over application is desired.\nWhen using an existing sprinkler system, increase\nnozzle size in two adjacent sprinkler heads. Install a\nvalve just below the sprinkler head so discharge can\nbe controlled when setting out, starting and stopping\nthe test, and retrieving the catch containers. Excessive\napplication rate needs to occur somewhere in the\nsprinkler or spray pattern. This provides a spot or area\nin the sprinkler pattern that is near the maximum\napplication rate. Set out a linear series of catch con-\ntainers in this area. Record time of start and stop of\ncatch. Observe soil surface condition in the area\naround the containers for under application, adequate\napplication, and over application rates.",

The\nmaximum allowable application rate based on visual\nobservation can be displayed in table 2–8, Chapter 2,\nSoils. This value is used when designing fixed set or\nperiodic move sprinkler systems on the kind of soil\ntested. Factors developed (or affirmed) in the local\narea are used to adjust the long-term maximum allow-\nable application rate for shorter duration applications\nmade with continuous move sprinkler systems. See\ncontinuous move system evaluation procedure.\n(ii) Continuous move systems—center pivot or\nlinear move (using catch containers)\nSite selection:\nCarefully preselect sites in advance for specific soil\nseries, surface texture, and crop. Replicated measure-\nments (3 to 5) on a few typical extensive soil series\nand surface textures provide more reliable information\nthan a single measurement on a large number of soil\nseries.\nMeasurements made on predominant soil series and\nsurface textures for each land resource area at care-\nfully select model sites for each soil are suggested.\nAlso, replicated measurements on a few typical domi-\nnant soils provide more reliable information than a\nsingle measurement on a large number of soils. The\ndata can be projected to other close related soils.\nA soil scientist should identify and correlate soil series\nand surface texture at each test site. Identify test site\nwith reference to span number, field edge, and direc-\ntion from pivot. Specific location of test sites is not\neasy to identify until the pivot system has made sev-\neral rotations and areas of runoff observed.\nSoil surface condition must be described as to crop\nresidue on the soil surface and soil surface storage,\nsoil condition, and cultivation practices.\nPerforming tests:\nUse the following procedure to measure maximum\nallowable sprinkler application rate:\nStep 1—Place a minimum of five groups of catch\ncontainers or rain gauges (suggest three containers in\na group) in a line perpendicular to the lateral in the\narea of observed maximum application rate. Distance\nbetween groups of catch containers depends on spray\npattern width. Suggested maximum distance is 10 feet.\nFor low pressure systems, the distance may be rela-\ntively short, 4 to 5 feet.\nStep 2—Cover all containers. The center group of\ncontainers must be directly under the spray head when\ntest is started, with equal groups of containers forward\nand rearward of the direction of movement.\nStep 3—Quickly remove all covers from containers\nwhen spray nozzle is directly over the center group of\ncontainers. Observe intake characteristics of soil\nthroughout the test.\nStep 4—After 5 to 10 minutes of operation, cover\ncontainers as quickly as possible.\nStep 5—Measure water volume caught in each con-\ntainer and convert to application rate in inches per\nhour. Average group of three containers into one\nvalue. Containers within a group are equal distance\nfrom the lateral. The group of containers with the\nlargest quantity will represent the average application\nrate for that time duration (5 to 10 minutes). This\napproximates the maximum rate of the soil with a\nsystem similarly equipped moving at the given rate.\nDepth caught, inches\nTime of catch, min 60 min/hr \t____ inches per hour\t( \t) =\nStep 6—Duplicate tests at other locations along the\nlateral in the same general area. This tends to elimi-\nnate the effect of nozzle pattern and start-stop opera-\ntion and the effect on application rate.\nStep 7—Additional tests may be needed (closer to-\nward the pivot or toward the end) to determine maxi-\nmum soil intake rate for that site, depending on loca-\ntion of runoff. This point is not necessarily be easy to\nobserve until after some practice. In fact, runoff may\nnot occur at the same location each rotation.",

The gauge can be relocated in front of\nthe moving pivot lateral and quickly set up for another\ntest. Setting up one recording gauge is faster than\nsetting out a series of catch containers. Limitations are\ncrop height and elevation of spray or sprinkler heads\nabove the ground. When used to catch the applied\nwater during the entire pass, any increment of time\ncan be used to plot application rate versus time. Be-\ncause of the short application time with low pressure\nsystems, timely observation of application and runoff\nis essential. Use of waterproof rain gear is recom-\nmended to be close enough to the catch device to\nmake good visual observations at ground surface.\n652.0906 \tWater measure-\nment\n(a) General\nHigh irrigation application efficiencies require apply-\ning uniform, predetermined amounts of water onto the\nfield at the proper time (irrigation scheduling). Mea-\nsurement accuracy of applied water needs to be suffi-\ncient to make the decision: \"When should irrigation\nchange to another area or cease entirely?\" Too often,\nplant water needs are measured or calculated accu-\nrately, then water is applied with no thought of mea-\nsurement.\nRefer to Water Measurement Manual, Bureau of Recla-\nmation (1997) for flow characteristics, siting, rating\ntables, and recommended operation and maintenance\nof water measuring devices.\n(b) Using water measurement\nWater measurement has traditionally been used to\nregulate the division of irrigation water between\ngroups (irrigation organizations, districts, or compa-\nnies) or individuals. Irrigation districts or organiza-\ntions in turn use water measuring to portion water\nbetween individuals within a district. Thus, water\nmeasurement is often perceived as a regulatory action.\nWater users also view the installation of water mea-\nsurement devices as a cost and a nuisance with little\nreturn on investment.\nThe benefits of providing onfield water measurement\nfor water management purposes are incalculable.\nInvestment costs are often returned many times during\none irrigation season. Typically, at least 10 to 30 per-\ncent additional area can be irrigated with the same\namount of water. Inversely, 10 to 30 percent less water\ncan be used to irrigate the same area when water is\nmeasured. Crop yield or quality of product almost\nalways improves with improved water management.\nApplying a measured, predetermined amount of water\nonto a field at the proper time is the basis for good\nirrigation water management.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–206 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nSeveral accurate methods are used to determine plant\nwater needs and available soil water. Combining these\ntwo factors determines when and how much irrigation\nwater to apply (irrigation scheduling). Where water\nsupplies are not limited, over irrigation (with associ-\nated yield reduction or soil and water resource degra-\ndation) is by far the greatest irrigation water manage-\nment problem. Water measurement onto the field can\nhelp avoid over (or under) irrigation.\nSuccessful micro irrigation depends on an accurate\nknowledge of flow rates. Water measurement devices\nallow for determination of line or emitter plugging,\nwhich then allows for line flushing or chemical treat-\nment. With sprinkler systems, water measurement\ndevices allow for determination of worn and plugged\nnozzles and excessive gasket leaks. Unexplained\nchanges in flow indicate something in the system has\nchanged and needs attention. A good example may be\nworn sprinkler nozzles. They provide an opportunity\nfor system flow to increase, especially where the\npump can provide additional flow. Overall pump\nefficiency is often decreased.\n(c) Basic hydraulic concepts\nFlow measurement is based on specific predetermined\nhydraulic concepts. Measurement accuracy is strongly\ninfluenced by adherence to these concepts. For open\nchannel weirs and fumes, water must pass through\ncritical depth or two flow depths must be measured.\nWith closed conduits the pipeline must be flowing full\nat the measuring device.

All fluid meters consist of two distinct sub-\nunits:\n• The primary element that interacts with the fluid.\n• The secondary element that translates the inter-\naction into flow quantities (volumes, weights) or\nflow rates (quantity per unit time) that can be\nobserved and acted on by an operator or by\ncontrol equipment.\nBasically all flow meters, whether for irrigation or\nindustrial pipe flows, use at least one of a few basic\nphysical principles and properties of fluids. These\ninclude fluid mass, weight, volume, viscosity, and\nmixing types of properties, as well as the electrical,\nmagnetic, thermal, optical, and acoustical types.\nForce, momentum, and energy principles (including\nforce-velocity effects on floats) are commonly used, as\nwell as energy conversions (kinetic to potential or\npotential to kinetic), heat, or electromagnetic energy.\nOther physical principles include electromagnetic or\nacoustical wave transmission, distortion, or refraction;\nreflection by the fluid or tracer particles in the fluid;\nunclear magnetic resonance behavior of certain polar-\nfluid molecules; and fluid such behaviors as wall\nclinging and vortex formations by shaped flow cavities\nand obstructions in the conduit. Representatives of\nthese groups are in table 9–5.\nSometimes classifying a particular flow metering\nsystem is a problem when it is perceived to use more\nthan one principle, or even the wrong principle. For\nexample, ultrasonic doppler meters use ultrasonic\nwaves as a type of radar system that detects the veloc-\nity of moving particles in a flow. Thus, it depends on\nthe force-velocity effects of the fluid on suspended\nparticles.\nAlmost all recent claims for new flow measuring\ntechniques are improvements in the readout format or\nin the detection of some primary interaction with\nwater flow. Such is the case with ultrasonic flow\nmeters.\nMeter classification, while giving a general framework\nand understanding of flow metering promises and\nlimitations, is somewhat subjective. Variations occur\nbetween classifiers; thus the classification used in\ntable 9–5 is not sacred, but is convenient for compari-\nsons.",

The classification of flumes and weirs, some-\ntimes listed as part of the variable head and area group\nof flow meters and sometimes as part of the differen-\ntial head group, convert potential energy to kinetic\nenergy to cause critical flow. If enough potential\nenergy is not converted because of a high downstream\nwater surface elevation, the device becomes a Venturi\nflume. The general Venturi flume operates on the same\ntheory as a Venturi meter in pipe flows. Because the\npressure differences generally are small, their use\nrequires two depth measurements of high precision,\none upstream and one in the throat region. These\nprecise measurements generally are not practical in\nthe field. General Venturi flumes are not commonly\nused for this reason. Critical-flow flumes are a special\ncase of the Venturi flume where the critical condition\neliminates the need for the throat measurement.\nFlumes and weirs can be subdivided into sharp-\ncrested weirs, short-crested weirs, broadcrested weirs,\nshort-throated flumes, and long-throated flumes. A\nsummary of their general characteristics is shown in\ntable 9–6.\n(1) Sharp-crested weirs\nSharp-crested weirs are one of the oldest open channel\nflow measuring devices. Head-discharge equations\nwere derived from laboratory ratings. They are influ-\nenced by the flow bending in the crest region. The\nlocation of upstream sidewalls and floor elevations, as\nwell as the condition of sharpness at the sharp edge,\nare part of the calibration.\nFor usual open channel applications, the difference in\nwater surface elevation between upstream and down-\nstream must be large enough to allow complete free\noverfall. An exception may be sharp crested V-notch\nweirs where 30 to 40 percent submergence can some-\ntimes be tolerated. The usual recommendation is that\nthe downstream water surface be at least 2 inches (50\nmm) below the crest of the weir opening. Adequate\naeration of the nappe (between downstream weir wall\nand backside water surface) must be available.\n(2) Short-crested weirs\nThe most common example of short-crested weirs is\nthe V-notch weir sill. A V-notch, thick-sill weir has\ntriangular openings with sides formed by slopes as flat\nas 10 horizontal to 1 vertical. A common format is to\nconstruct weirs as vertical retaining walls about 1.5\ninches (40 mm) thick with the top edge receiving a\nprescribed bevel upstream and downstream of 3\nhorizontal to 1 vertical. The resulting edge has a hori-\nzontal portion that is about 4 inches (100 mm) wide.\n(3) Broadcrested weirs\nA wide variety of shapes can be included under\nbroadcrested weirs, and a wide variety of discharge\ncoefficients will be encountered. Most broadcrested\nweirs offer no advantage over flat-plate, sharp-crested\nweirs for measuring flows. As a result, broadcrested\nweirs are seldom used for measuring purposes. This\ndoes not imply that they cannot be used as accurate\nflow measuring devices because in some cases they\nare desirable. For example, if difficulty is expected in\nmaintaining a flat-plate weir in good condition because\nof rusting, impact, or abrasion, a broadcrested weir\nshould be used. If possible, the crest shape should\nconform to the shape of some other structure or\nmodel for which the coefficient of discharge has been\nexperimentally determined. If this is not practicable,\nthe crest must be calibrated either by field tests on the\nactual structure or by model studies of it.\n(4) Movable weirs and adjustable weirs\nMovable weirs are weir assemblies mounted in metal\nand timber frames that can be moved from one struc-\nture to another. The frames fit freely into slots pro-\nvided in the structures and are not fastened in place.\nAdjustable weirs are weir assemblies mounted in\nmetal frames permanently fastened to the structures.\nThe weir blades in both the movable and the fixed\nframes can be raised or lowered to the desirable\nelevations, usually by threaded stems and hand\nwheels.\nA sufficiently large pool must be provided upstream\nfrom the weir to slow and quiet the flow as it ap-\nproaches the notch in the weir. A fixed head gauge is\nnot generally useful for flow measurement if the weir\nis to be moved up or down because the zero of the\ngauge does not coincide with the elevation of the weir\ncrest.",

They\ninclude flumes with side contractions and bottom\ncontractions (weirs not sharp-crested) with some type\nof transition section. However, the flow curves enough\nto again require the use of laboratory calibrations and\nflow coefficients. Familiar examples are the Parshall\nflume and the cutthroat flume. Deviations from stan-\ndard plans may be difficult to evaluate without special\nfield or model ratings.\n(6) Long-throated flumes\nThese flumes are also called the computables because\ntheir construction specifications are such that parallel,\nnot curvilinear, flow is produced. This allows accurate\nprediction of their hydraulic behavior. It also permits\nestimates of effects of construction anomalies. In\nthese flumes, the streamline curvature is limited by\nproviding gentle contractions from the upstream\nchannel to the throat section. The throat section itself\nis made long enough (preferably about 1.5 times the\nmaximum expected upstream head reading, refer-\nenced to the bottom centerline of the level throat) to\nprovide nearly parallel flow through the control area.\nThe horizontal location of the control section does not\nneed to be precisely known. Its vertical reference is\nneeded for total energy head computations. This\nvertical reference is most easily handled in the compu-\ntations if the throat is level in the direction of flow. A 1\npercent error in cross slope approximates an addi-\ntional 1 percent error in accuracy.\n(7) Long-throated flumes, modified\nbroadcrested weir, Replogle or Ramp\nflumes\nThe modified broadcrested weir, sometimes called a\nRamp flume or Replogle flume, has nearly the same\noperating characteristics as long-throated flumes. By\ndefinition, the long-throated flume is a cut-throat\nflume where the downstream or discharge portion of\nthe flume has been eliminated. It is perhaps the most\naccurate and easiest to construct of all open channel,\nlow head, flow measuring devices. The weir sill is the\nonly critical surface, which is level. A 1 percent error\nin cross slope (the level bubble is not visible in the\ncarpenter level site glass) approximates an additional\n1 percent error in accuracy. The slope of the ramp up\nto the sill should approximate three horizontal to one\nvertical. The long-throated flume requires a short\nflume (usually less than 10 feet) or lined ditch. The\nlong-throated flume can be located within any cross\narea. Computer software has been developed to calcu-\nlate flow rates through any cross sectional area. Dis-\ncharge flow rate tables have been developed for stan-\ndard geometric cross sections.\nThe Replogle flume can be used as a measuring device\nin pressure pipelines. Two pressure (head) readings\nare needed in the pipeline, one in the throat and one\nupstream. The flume can be oriented in any direction.\nReplogle flumes and certain properly dimensioned,\nbroadcrested weirs form the class of computable\nflumes. These styles can be proportioned so that\nalmost any flow can be measured. Small flows are\nleast accurate to measure because of the difficulty of\nobtaining precision depth readings. Generally, flows\nlarger than about 150 gallons per minute (10 L/s) can\nbe measured with an error of less than 2 percent in an\nappropriately dimensioned flume. There is no theoreti-\ncal upper limit on size. Replogle flumes capable of\nmeasuring over 3,000 cubic feet per second (85 m 3/s)\nhave been constructed in Arizona.\nFor a complete treatment of these flumes, see Flow\nMeasuring Flumes for Open Channel Flow Systems,\nby Bos, Replogle, and Clemmens (1991).\n(j) Demands made on a measuring\ndevice\nThe actual selection of a flow measuring device type\nand size depends on its functional requirements, the\nrequired accuracy, the desired flow range, debris in\nwater, installation location, and several other consid-\nerations discussed below.\n(1) Functions of the device\nDevices for measuring flow often serve two basic\nfunctions in their application. One is to indicate flow\nrate or volume, and the other is to control the flow\nrate or volume. In this section we distinguish between\nthe measuring and control functions and emphasize\nmeasuring devices for open channel flows.\nGood quality flow rate measurement and good quality\ncontrol are best achieved with two separate devices.\nHowever, dual function devices are used. An example\nis a variable area orifice meter, such as an irrigation\ncanal slide gate. Another is the vertically adjustable\nweir.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–213\t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nMost meters require some head loss to measure flow.\nUltrasonic meters cause negligible head loss, but must\nintroduce an outside source of sonic energy. Likewise,\na piston pump used as a positive displacement meter\ncan introduce a head gain into the measured flow, and\nuses power for pumping.\n(i) \tRequired head loss for pipe flow meters—\nHead loss implications for pipes and open channels\ndiffer considerably, as mentioned before. Available\nhead loss in pipes is generally used to determine\nwhether the meter can be successfully incorporated\ninto the system. If not, pressure may need to be in-\ncreased or another size or type of meter selected.\nIn pipe flows, available head loss can influence the\ntype of differential head meter selected. Pipe meters\nvary widely in the pressure drop imposed. For ex-\nample, the passive type orifice meters produce higher\npressure drop than do Venturi meters. Propeller and\nturbine meters vary according to their special designs.\nUnfortunately, low head loss propellers and turbines\ngenerally trade off accuracy because they achieve\ntheir low loss by sampling a limited cross section of\nthe flow. Active meters, including sonic and electro-\nmagnetic, introduce negligible head loss, but have\ngenerally been expensive.\n(ii) Required head drop for open channels—The\nhead loss requirement is particularly important in\nopen channel water measuring devices. Most of these\ndevices depend on creating critical flow at an overfall\nor channel contraction as is the case with flumes and\nweirs. This is in contrast to the head loss in pipes that\nis usually of little importance to the meter function\nitself, but is more important to the ability of the pipe\nsystem to deliver the needed flow rates.\n(2) Accuracy of measurement\nThe accuracy of discharge measured with a particular\nstructure is limited to the accuracy that a measure-\nment can be reproduced. If two identical structures\nare independently and correctly constructed, then\npresented with flow at the same upstream sill-refer-\nenced head, both flow rates are not likely to be equal.\nFor flumes and weirs constructed as described herein,\nthe difference between the presented flow calibrations\nand absolute accuracy have been determined to be\nless than 2 percent.\nIn addition to the above uncertainty of error in the\nbasic discharge equation, three other types of errors\ncan affect either the primary meter type or the second-\nary readout device. They are systematic, random, and\nspurious errors.\n(i) \tSystematic errors—These errors are generally\nassociated with dimensional problems, such as gauge\nzero settings or area changes resulting from plant\ngrowths or soil deposits on the channel or pipe walls,\nor to structural deflections. Systematic errors can be\ncorrected if they are known.\n(ii) Random errors—If several people read a wall\nmounted gauge or dial and record a flow rate from a\nchart, the variation in flow readings should be ran-\ndomly distributed about the true average. These errors\nare subject to statistical treatment.\n(iii) Spurious errors—These errors invalidate the\nmeasurements because of human mistakes, recording\nequipment malfunction, or obstructions of normal\nflow.\nIn selecting a measuring device, appropriate precision\nand accuracy should be carefully specified. The pur-\nposes of the flow measurement should dominate this\nspecification. For usual irrigation management pro-\ncesses, accuracies of about 5 percent are suitable.\nAccuracy needs to be sufficient to make a decision,\nsuch as to change flow rate or cease irrigation entirely.\nIf one were trying to determine seepage losses by\nmeasuring inflow and outflow in a reach of canal, then\nplus or minus 1 percent may not be sensitive enough.\n(3) Sediment discharge capability\nBesides transporting water, almost all open channels\ntransport some sediment and debris. Bedload sedi-\nment is generally the most difficult to accommodate in\nmeasuring devices. The ability of various long-throated\nflumes to carry sediment depends, among other things,\non the absolute velocity of the water, the density and\nsize of the sediment particles, and the sediment con-\ncentration. A general discussion is presented in Flow\nMeasuring Flumes for Open Channel Systems, by\nBos, Replogle, and Clemmens (1991).\nA major condition appears to be the throat width. The\nflume or weir throat width should be as wide as, or\nwider than, the approach channel delivering the sedi-\nment (e.g., sills in trapezoidal channels). This is based",

The slope of\nthe ramp appears to play a small role in retarding\nsediment movement, particularly if it is on a slope of 3\nor 4 horizontal to 1 vertical. This contradicts former\npractices that recommended leaving a continuing\nchannel floor for sediment transport and constructing\nflumes with only side contractions.\n(i) \tPassing of floating and suspended debris—\nOpen channels transport various kinds and amounts of\nfloating or suspended debris. To avoid catching debris,\nthe staff gauge or recorder housing should be located\nto one side of the flow pattern. Most long-throated\nflumes are streamlined enough to avoid debris trap-\nping unless the debris is larger than the throat. Parallel\ninstallations should have rounded piers that are at\nleast 12 inches (300 mm) wide. Sharp-nosed and\nnarrow piers tend to catch debris.\nMost pipeline meters do not tolerate debris well,\nespecially moss. Trash screens and racks should be\nused to keep debris out of the pipeline if it adversely\naffects the measuring device. Venturi, magnetic, sonic,\nand other meters that can handle suspended debris are\ndescribed in a later section.\n(k) Getting the most from open\nchannel measuring devices\nMost users desire to get the maximum performance\nand functions from a given gate, weir, meter, or meter-\ning system. This encourages attempts to try measuring\nand controlling flow with the same device. This is not\ngenerally recommended because it results in degraded\nmeasurement and degraded control. One exception\nmight be the vertically movable flume. When ad-\nequately automated, it can measure flows with the\nprecision of flumes and also control to the precision of\nthe selected automation equipment. Equipment costs\nand labor may not compete with a fixed flume and\nregulating gate, which could also be automated. An-\nother exception is the vertical moving sharp-crested\nweir. The weir is a cut-out in the upper part of a stan-\ndard irrigation canal slide gate. Fluctuations in the\nwater surface in the canal create a degraded measure-\nment and require frequent operator control and moni-\ntoring.\n(l) Matching requirements and\nmeter capabilities\nSelections of the measuring site and the appropriate\nmeasuring device are closely related. Some devices or\nstructures are more appropriate for certain sites than\nothers. Some sites require a certain device or struc-\nture. Site consideration, particularly for open chan-\nnels, must be given to the exact location, elevation,\nand upstream and downstream flow conditions. This\ninformation is needed in addition to the general loca-\ntion and the structural shape.\nIn pipe flows, pipe pressures and head loss generally\nreceive only passing attention. In open channel flows,\nhead loss may be the prime consideration because of\nthe sensitive relationships among the water surface,\ntotal energy, and flow rate.\nThe measuring method must be compatible with the\nwater delivery method and purpose of the delivery. If\nflow rate is the needed information, then rate meters\nare usually appropriate. For open channel flows, rate\nmeters generally are less expensive than totalizing\nmeters. Pipeline meters that totalize from some kind\nof rotating impeller are less expensive than flow rate\nmeters. For billing purposes, totalizing meters are\nusually specified.\nPipe flows, because of their fixed flow area, can ac-\ncommodate many meter styles that basically provide a\nflow velocity that is combined with the inside pipe\ndiameter to obtain flow rate. Open-channel flow\nmeters add the complication of variable flow area.\n(m) Open channel flow measure-\nments\nThis section describes the design, selection, and\ninstallation of weirs and flumes in open channels.\nFrequency and duration of measurements determine\nwhether to select a portable, temporary, or permanent\nmeasuring device or structure. A variety of portable\nstructures are described in Bos, et al. (1991). Often\npermanent measuring structures, such as Replogle\nflumes, can be installed at all sites for equal or little\nincreased cost over that required for installing mount-\ning brackets at each site and purchasing portable flow\nmeasuring devices.",

Design is a process between these steps.\nThe order and importance of these steps depend on\nspecific conditions encountered. If a structure to\nmeasure or regulate the flow rate is to function well, it\nmust be selected properly. All demands that will be\nmade on the structure should be listed and matched\nwith the properties of known structures. Broadly\nspeaking, these demands or operational requirements\noriginate from four sources: hydraulic performance,\nconstruction and/or installation cost, ease with which\nthe structure can be operated, and cost of mainte-\nnance.\n(2 ) Locating and selecting the measuring site\nand device\nAll structures for measuring or regulating the rate of\nflow should be located in a channel reach where an\naccurate value of head can be measured. Also, suffi-\ncient head loss must be created to obtain a unique\nflow rate versus head relation (modular flow). The\nsurvey of a channel to find a suitable location for a\nstructure should also provide information on a number\nof relevant factors that influence the performance of a\nfuture structure. These factors are described in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\nUpstream of the potential site, the channel should be\nstraight and have a reasonably uniform cross-section\nfor a length equal to about 10 times its average width.\nIf a bend is closer to the structure, water elevations\nalong the sides of the channel become different. Rea-\nsonably accurate measurements can be made (added\nerror about 3%) if the upstream straight channel has a\nlength equal to about two times its width. In this case\nthe water level should be measured at the inner bend\nof the channel.\nThe channel reach should have a stable bottom eleva-\ntion. In some channel reaches, sedimentation occurs\nin dry seasons or periods of low water. The sediment\nmay be eroded again during the wet season. Such\nsedimentation can change the approach velocity\ntoward the structure or may even bury a flow measur-\ning structure. Erosion may undercut the foundation of\nthe structure.\nWater level in the channel generally should be predict-\nable. Water surface elevations are affected by channel\ndischarge, downstream confluences with other chan-\nnels, operation of gates, and reservoir operation.\nChannel water surface elevations greatly influence the\nsill height to obtain modular flow through a measuring\nstructure.\nBased on channel water surface elevations and the\nrequired sill height in combination with the flow\nversus head relation of the structure, the possible\ninundation of upstream surroundings should be as-\nsessed. These inundations cause sedimentation be-\ncause of the subsequent reduction in approach flow\nvelocities.\nSoil conditions at the site can influence the tendency\nfor leakage around and beneath the measuring struc-\nture caused by the head differential. Excess leakage\nmust be prevented at reasonable costs. Also, a stable\nfoundation, without significant settling is important.\nTo avoid sedimentation upstream of the structure,\nsufficient head must be available in the selected chan-\nnel reach to control flow velocities. For more details\non sediment handling, see Bos, et al. (1991).\n(3) Measurement of head\nAs discussed above, the accuracy of a flow measure-\nment depends strongly on the true determination of\nthe upstream, sill-referenced head. The success of a\nmeasuring structure often depends entirely on the\neffectiveness of the gauge or recorder used and de-\nsires of the operator.\nA sill-reference head refers to the effective hydraulic\ncontrol section. With broadcrested weirs and flumes,\nthis section is located on the weir crest or flume\nthroat, a distance of about one-third the length up-\nstream of the downstream edge of the sill. The top of\nthe sill (weir crest or invert of flume throat) must be\nlevel in the direction of the flow. If minor undulations\nare on the sill crest, it is recommended that the aver-\nage level at the effective control section be used rather\nthan the average level of the entire sill. See figure 9–40.\nWith sharp-crested weirs, hydraulic control occurs\nimmediately upstream of the weir crest. Distance\nvaries relative to approach velocities. Actual location\ncan be observed by the light reflection pattern on the\nflowing water surface. See figure 9–41.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–216 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\n(4) Location of head measurement\nThe gauging or head-measuring station should be\nlocated sufficiently upstream to avoid detectable\nwater surface drawdown, but close enough for the\nenergy losses between the gauging station and ap-\nproach section to be negligible. Typically, this distance\nvaries between two and four times the total head loss\nupstream of the weir crest.\n(5) Head measurement method\nThe head generally is measured either in the channel\nitself or in a stilling well located to one side of the\nchannel. The stilling well is connected to the channel\nby a small pipe (to dampen head fluctuations). Many\nmethods can be used to detect water surface eleva-\ntion. Some use the electromagnetic properties of water\nand of the water-air interface. Other methods depend\non reflecting a sonic wave from the water surface. Still\nother methods detect water depth with a variety of\npressure sensing devices and deduce the head from\nthat information. The most frequently encountered\nmethods are vertical and sidewall mounted staff\ngauges in the canal or in a stilling well, or both, and\nfloat-operated recorders placed in a stilling well.\nDigital recorders and data logging devices are readily\navailable and have typically replaced the continuous\nrecording devices on rotating drums (ink pens and\npaper rolls).\n(i) \tStilling wells—Stilling wells facilitate the\naccurate reading of the water level at a gauging station\nwhere the water surface is disturbed by wave action. It\ncan also house the float for a recorder system or other\nwater surface detecting equipment. The size of the\nstilling well depends on the method used to measure\nthe head. The diameter, if circular-shaped, ranges from\na recommended minimum size of 4 inches (0.1 m) for\nhand-inserted dipsticks to over 20 inches (0.5 m) to\naccommodate large diameter floats. The pipe connect-\ning the stilling well to the canal should be large enough\nto allow the stilling well to respond quickly to water\nlevel changes. In most cases the pipe diameter is about\none-tenth the diameter of the stilling well. Further\ndetails on stilling wells are in Bos, et al. (1991).\n(ii) Staff gauges—Periodic readings on a cali-\nbrated staff gauge can be adequate when continuous\ninformation on the flow rate is not required. Examples\nare canals where the fluctuation of flow is gradual.\nThe gauge should be placed so the water level can be\nread from the canal bank. Staff gauges are commonly\nused where quick readings can be taken without\nentering a locked house to read a continuous recorder.\nThe surface of the staff gauge should be kept clean.\nFor concrete-lined canals, the gauge can be mounted\ndirectly on the canal wall. The value, read on the\nsloping walls of trapezoidal-shaped canals, must be\nappropriately converted by scale or table to vertical\nhead values before entering discharge tables. Tables\nare made for stilling well use or vertical gauge applica-\ntions. For unlined canals, the gauge can be mounted\nonto a vertical support.\nMost permanent gauges are enameled steel, cast\naluminum, or some type of plastic resin. Enameled\nlinear scales marked in English or metric units are\navailable from commercial sources. Important flow\nrates can be noted on these scales by separate mark-\nings to avoid the need for tables to be always at hand.\nFigure 9–40 \tProfile of long-throated flume (from Bos,\nReplogle, Clemmens)\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\t\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0002\t\u0003Channel bottom\nSharped-crested\nweir\n\tWater surface\n4H\nPoint to measure\ndepth (H)\nElevation of\nweir crest\nH\n2H\nFigure 9–41 \tProfile of sharp-crested weir\n\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\t\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\nGauge\nS\nL\t3 x S \tChannel bottom\nFlow\n3:1",

The gauges of these structures can be\nconveniently marked directly in discharge units rather\nthan in head or depth units.\n(6) Selection of head-measurement device\nThe success or failure a water measuring structure and\nthe value of the collected data depend closely on\nproper selection of a suitable head measurement\ndevice. The three most important factors that influ-\nence this selection are frequency of discharge mea-\nsurement, allowable error in the head detection, and\ntype of measurement structure under consideration.\n(7) Gauge placement and zero-setting\nThe most important factor in obtaining accurate\ndischarge measurements is the accurate determination\nof the sill referenced head. The upstream sill refer-\nenced head can be measured by a gauge or recorder\nonly if the observed water level is known with respect\nto the weir sill (or flume crest) elevation at the control\nsection. The method used to set (zero register) the\ngauge and recorder depends on the structure size,\ntype, flow rate in the channel during the setting proce-\ndure, and available equipment. Standard surveying\ntechniques are practical for accurate setting of most\nwall or staff gauges.\nThe canal side slopes only approximate the intended\nslope. To compensate partly for this, the gauge can be\nmounted so that a selected scale reading from the\nmost frequently used range of the gauge coincides\nwith the corresponding elevation for that reading.\nThus, greatest reading errors occur in the flow ranges\nthat are seldom used. If this procedure causes the zero\nend of the scale to be displaced by more than about\n1/4 inch (5 mm), the actual side slope should be deter-\nmined for adjustments to the calibration. This also\nshould be done if accuracy over the full flow range is\nrequired.\nSeveral methods are available for zeroing a water level\nrecorder; three are particularly suitable. The recorder\ncan be set when the canal is dry, when water is\nponded over the flume, or when water is flowing\nthrough the flume. These zero-setting methods assume\nthat the sill referenced elevation can be determined\nduring the procedure. This is not always practical,\nespecially on wide structures. A stable and permanent\nsurveying benchmark should be added to these struc-\ntures. The benchmark can be a metal rod or cap\nplaced in concrete. Its elevation should have been\npreviously established relative to the sill elevation.\nMore detailed information on zero-setting procedures\nis in Bos, et al. (1991).\n(8) Determining structure dimensions\nLong-throated flumes and broadcrested weirs operate\nby using a channel contraction to cause critical flow. If\nthere is not enough contraction, critical flow does not\noccur. Flow is then nonmodular, and gauge readings\nbecome meaningless. If there is too much contraction,\nthe water surface upstream may be raised excessively\nand cause canal overtopping or other problems. The\nchallenge facing the designer is to select the shape of\nthe control section, or throat, so that critical flow\noccurs throughout the full range of discharges to be\nmeasured. Also, the designer must provide acceptable\nsensitivity and accuracy while not causing too much\ndisruption in upstream flow conditions (sediment\ndeposition, canal overtopping). This appears to be a\ndifficult task, but existing design aids and rating tables\nmake this task more manageable.\nFlumes and weirs constructed of wood can be used.\nHowever, until flow through a wood structure begins,\nit must be weighted down or be well anchored to\nprevent flotation. If a wood structure floats after flow\nbegins, the flume or weir is said to be submerged, thus\nunusable. A different size or structure should be\ninstalled.\n(n) Pipeline flow meters and\napplications\nFlow meters for pipelines are frequently used for\nirrigation water management decisions, particularly\nwhere pumped wells are used. Some flow meters are\nwell established. Other less well known meters are\ndescribed in some detail herein. The familiar meters\nare given less treatment because they are either well\ndocumented or are judged to be of limited application\nto irrigation. Yet another group is too new to irrigation\nto have an extensive history in this application; there-\nfore, they are again given broader treatment.\nSome of the newer pipe flow meters have very low\nhead loss. They include vortex shedding meters,\nmagnetic flow meters, and sonic flow meters. The last\ntwo meters can operate with no detectable head loss",

The head loss is low, and slurries pass readily.\nIn irrigation works, small venturi meters are used for\nchemical injection applications. Sizes compatible with\nmost irrigation wells generally are considered too\ncostly. The flow range is similar to that of the orifice\nmeters, which are described later in this chapter.\nThese devices are well covered in the literature, and\nlittle new information is available. See: Handbook of\nHydraulics, King and Brater, for a complete descrip-\ntion of these meters.\nCertain angles of convergence and divergence must be\nobserved for standard venturi meter behavior. The\nconduit walls should converge relative to the\ncenterline at about 10 degrees and diverge on the\ndownstream side at about 5 to 7 degrees. Low velocity\nventuri meters have also been constructed from ordi-\nnary PVC pipe and fittings. Where throat lengths are at\nleast three times the diameter of the pipe, fitting\nconfiguration appears to have little effect. Venture\nflow meters require two pressure taps, one in the\nthroat and one upstream before convergence. Typi-\ncally venturi flow meters have low head loss. To keep\nventuri flow meters to a reasonable size on large\npipelines, they are often used as a shunt meter, where\na much reduced part of the total flow is actually mea-\nsured. The ratio must be known to project the mea-\nsured flow to total pipe flow. Chemical injection\nsystems often use a shunt Venturi.\n(2) Pitot tubes\nLike venturi meters, pitot tubes are well documented\nin King and Brater, 1954. The original version is named\nfor Henri Pitot who used a bent glass tube to measure\nvelocities in the River Seine in 1730. Pitot tubes have a\nnarrow range of application similar to venturi meters.\nA flow-differential version is the standard prandtl tube\nthat incorporates the impact pitot tube within a jack-\neted concentric outer tube. Holes in the side of this\nouter tube are used to detect the existing static pres-\nsure in the flow region.\nThe difference between the impact pressure and the\nstatic pressure represents the velocity head, from\nwhich the point velocity is computed. An impact pitot\ntube and a pipe wall piezometer tap are frequently\nused to accomplish the same thing. Several variations\nof pitot tube based devices are marketed. Most of the\nvariations depend on careful laboratory calibration.\nStandard pitot tubes and the prandtl type tubes have a\ncoefficient nearly equal to unity. These tubes are best\nused for intermittent and attended measurements\nbecause they are subject to clogging in all but the\ncleanest flows.\n(3) Orifice meters\nMany of the marketed flow meters, for other than\nresidential use, are differential pressure types. Of\nthese the most common type is the sharp-edged orifice\nplate. Thousands of these meters measure gas, liquid,\nand mixed fluid streams in pipelines around the world.\nThe modern computer has given these primary mea-\nsuring devices renewed importance.\nOrifice flow meters are frequently used in irrigation\napplications for measuring well discharges and for\ninjecting agricultural chemicals into irrigation flows.\nThe latter are usually of small diameter and opera-\ntional details generally are furnished by the manufac-\nturer of the chemical injecting device. Consequently,\nlarger diameter orifice plates in round pipes are prima-\nrily dealt with in this guide. Usual rusted pipe condi-\ntions and general maintenance for irrigation wells limit\nfield accuracy in irrigation practice to no better than 3\nto 5 percent of actual flow.\nMost reliable flow meters require fairly stringent\ninstallation requirements. The orifice plate is no ex-\nception. Because abrupt pressure changes take place\nat the plate, the orifice plate is generally affected more\nby disturbed flows than other differential pressure\nmeters. Poor installation of an otherwise properly\ndesigned orifice plate can result in 20 percent errors.\nOrifice plate standards are based on extensive experi-\nmental data and can be applied with a fair degree of\nconfidence. Anomalies still exist, however, and some\nof which will be discussed later.\nAdvantages of the orifice plate are its simplicity and\nthe ability to select a proper calibration on the basis of\nthe measurements of the geometry. Disadvantages of\nthe orifice plate include the long, straight pipe length\nrequirements and the complication of extending the\nmeasuring range beyond a ratio of about one to three.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–219\t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nThe operating flow range can be changed by substitut-\ning an orifice plate with a different hole size. Tap\nlocations based on pipe diameter rather than orifice\ndiameter make this feasible because the same tap\nlocations can be used for all orifice plate sizes. The\npressure tap is located about one pipe diameter up-\nstream of the orifice plate. In a continuous pipeline,\nthe downstream pressure tap is located at the vena-\ncontracta (immediately downstream and adjacent to\nthe orifice plate).\nThe orifice plate should be mounted in such a way that\ninspecting at least the orifice plate and preferably the\nadjacent piping is possible. Portable orifice plate\nmeters can be attached to the downstream end of\ndischarge pipelines. Care should be taken to install the\nmeter level and have the appropriate straight pipe\nlength upstream of the orifice plate (generally a part of\nthe meter).\n(4) Rectangular sharp edged orifice/open\nchannel applications\nRectangular orifices formed by a partly open, irriga-\ntion canal gate are frequently used as flow indicating\ndevices. Accuracy of the primary opening, not includ-\ning the errors of secondary detection of depth, can be\nwithin 5 percent of actual. Every gate should be cali-\nbrated for specific onsite conditions.\nEarly day miners in the West developed a flow term\ncalled miners inches where a rectangular orifice (2\ninches high and up to 12 inches wide) was cut through\na 2-inch wooden plank. Thus, a 2-inch by 10-inch\norifice would deliver 20 miners inches. How to mea-\nsure the standard 6-inch hydraulic head on the orifice\nvaries between geographical areas. If the 6-inch head\nis measured from the horizontal center of the orifice to\nthe upstream water surface, 1.0 miners inches = 1/40\ncubic foot per second or 11.25 gallons per minute\n(applicable in Northern California, Arizona, Montana,\nNevada, and Oregon). Where the 6-inch head is mea-\nsured above the lower edge of the orifice, 1 miners\ninch = 1/50 cubic foot per second, or 9.0 gallons per\nminute (applicable in Southern California, Idaho,\nKansas, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota,\nNebraska, and Utah). In Colorado, 38.4 miners inches\n= 1 cubic foot per second.\n(5) Elbow meters\nElbow flow meters are made by drilling pressure taps\nmidway along the bend centerline on the inside and\nthe outside of the elbow bend (Spink 1967). This\ncorresponds to 45 degree tapping for a 90 degree\nelbow bend. If the radius of the inside bend is accu-\nrately determined by plaster casting or other means,\nthe discharge equation can be estimated to within 3\npercent of actual. The differential pressure across the\ninside and outside taps is produced by velocity differ-\nential and by the centrifugal force of fluid in the el-\nbow; velocity responds to about the square-root of the\nhead differential.\n(6) Current meters, propeller meters, and\ncuptype meters\nPropeller meters are commonly used in open channel\nflows to measure velocities at various points in the\nchannel cross-section. Cup type rotors are also used.\nThe choice depends on whether the user wishes to\ndetect velocities in the direction that the meter is\npointing (propeller) or whether all velocities in the\nflow plane are to be detected, regardless of flow\ndirection (cup type). Accurately determining cross-\nsectional area (especially depth), particularly with\nearth, grass lined, or cobbly bottom canals, is a major\nproblem with open channel applications. Another is\nvelocity distribution effects. The technician generally\ndivides the channel into about 10 equally spaced,\nvertical sections. If standard flow profiles can be\nassumed, a single measurement at 0.6 of the depth\nfrom the surface gives reasonable results. This depth\nis typically used in shallow flows. When depths permit,\n0.2 and 0.8 locations generally give more reliable\nresults. In fixed section channels, well-trained opera-\ntors using well-maintained equipment can expect\nresults with errors less then plus or minus 5 percent of\nthe actual flow rate.\nA short, smooth, level concrete section is often con-\nstructed in the open channel where long-term mea-\nsurements are made. This is done to reduce opportuni-\nties for errors. If a variety of flows over a wide flow\ndepth for any stable cross section can be measured,\nthe section can be rated. A staff gauge can then be\nused to measure depth and, with a rating table, con-\nverted to gallons per minute, cubic feet per second, or\nacre-inches per day. Occasionally, flow measurements\nare taken to check the rating table. USGS, state water\nresource agencies, and local irrigation organizations\nuse this method to measure larger flows in canals and",

Installation of a long-throated flume at these\nlocations should be considered.\nAs mentioned, major errors with the current metering\nmethod may be with the cross-section area determina-\ntion rather than velocity detection. For example, if a\nflow of 17-inch depth and 3-foot width is attempted in\na grass-lined channel, an uncertainty of the flow depth\nand width may be greater than 1 inch (30 mm) or over\n10 percent error in flow area. This uncertainty must be\ncombined with velocity errors.\n(7) Propeller meters\nPropeller meters are frequently used in irrigation\npipelines, particularly for flows from irrigation wells\nand at farm deliveries. Propeller meters offered for\nirrigation service generally stress ruggedness and\ndurability over accuracy. Secondary readout devices\nare usually mechanical. Recently, electronic readouts\nhave been offered. Most have less than plus or minus 3\npercent error when installation specifications are\nfollowed. Errors in field installations frequently ex-\nceed plus or minus 5 percent because some of the pipe\nlength requirements are hard to meet when retrofitting\nolder piping installations. Vanes can be used to mini-\nmize nonstandard installation conditions.\nThe main difference between a propeller and a turbine\nmeter is fewer blades on a propeller and the absence\nof a blade tip ring for blade stability. Propellers are\noften built with a swept-back design on two, three, or\nfour blades so they tend to shed debris. Some pipe\npropellers are restrained by the nose with a long\nsweeping shaft so that the mounting also sheds trash.\n(8) Turbine meters\nTurbine meters are used extensively in the gas and\npetroleum industries. They are especially applicable to\nflows in high pressure lines. More often the related\nfull-pipe diameter or part-pipe diameter blade is used.\nSeveral problems are associated with the use of tur-\nbine meters. Unlike simpler meter types, turbine\nmeters are viscosity-sensitive. Meters calibrated in\nwater, for instance, give different meter-factor curves\nwhen used in another fluid. The reasons are complex\nand are associated with the combination of lift, drag,\nand friction forces affecting the rotor and the bearings\ndifferently. Turbine meters are also sensitive to instal-\nlation conditions.\n(i) \tPaddle wheel turbines—Although not really a\npropeller, a small paddle wheel turbine is widely used\nin large diameter irrigation pipelines and supply wells.\nIt samples only the flow near the pipe wall. This veloc-\nity is converted to average flow velocity using general\nexpectations about flow velocity profiles in pipes. This\nmethod of flow measurement is sensitive to velocity\nchanges across the pipeline cross-section.\n(9) Vortex-shedding flow meter\nThe vortex-shedding meter is a relative newcomer to\npipeline flows. It is expected to essentially replace the\norifice meter. Application in irrigation pipelines,\nparticularly water delivered from wells, is a likely\napplication. The most common form of the vortex-\nshedding flow meter is a strut or bluff body placed in a\nturbulent stream. Periodic vortices generated, travel\nseveral pipe diameters downstream in the mean veloc-\nity of the stream.\nThe phenomenon is demonstrated by air flowing past a\nflagpole, which generates vortices that alternate on\neither side of the flag causing it to wave. Applied to a\nflow meter, the rate of vortices generated (the rate of\nvortex reversals) when flow strikes the blunt obstruc-\ntion, or bluff body, is sensed as a measure of passing\nflow. Passing vortices cause pockets of low pressure\nin the flow stream and allow for a variety of measure-\nment techniques in commercial flow meters, including\nultrasonic, thermal, mechanical, strain gauge, and\ndifferential pressure devices.\nLittle research has been reported on critical dimen-\nsions in the design of the bluff body (blunt obstruc-\ntion) to enhance strength of vortices. One study was\nconducted in the United Kingdom by Lucas and Turner\n(1985). They developed the critical dimension of a\nT-shaped bluff body that optimizes measure accuracy.\nThe response is linear with range abilities on the order\nof 100:1. The T-shaped buff body used has fast re-\nsponse capabilities with good accuracy, repeatability,\nand stable calibration conditions.\nThe major disadvantage of the T-shaped buff body is\nthe need to a have sufficient flow rate to create vorti-\nces. However, the device can be used at low flow rates\nwithout special detection methods. Other known\nproblems are associated with pipe vibrations. Outside\nvibration sources, such as from pump machinery,\nappear to interfere with vortex generation and detec-\ntion.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–221\t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nHead loss across a vortex shedding flow meter is\ntypically two pipe velocity heads, although this de-\npends on the blockage caused by the particular bluff\nbody. Fluid velocities of up to 150 feet per second can\nbe handled; however, high flow rate limitations do\nexist. In liquids these would be dictated by the onset\nof cavitation at the meter. Despite these limitations,\nvortex shedding flow meters may eventually replace\norifice plates at comparable cost.\n(10) Magnetic flow meters\nMagnetic, or electromagnetic, flow meters offer an\nexcellent solution to problems of flow measurement in\nconductive liquids. In recent years they have become\nwidely accepted in industry because of their many\nadvantages. Some advantages are no moving parts,\nhead loss equal to that of a similar length of pipe, and\naccurate measurements over a wide flow range.\nThe measuring principle is based on Faraday's law of\nelectromagnetic induction. Essentially, electrically\nconductive liquid flowing though a magnetic field\ninduces a voltage at right angles to the magnetic field\nand in the direction of flow. If the flux density is a\nconstant, the pipe diameter is fixed, and the pipe is\nflowing full, then the induced voltage is proportional\nto the velocity of the flowing liquid. The voltage gener-\nated can be AC or DC, depending on the electrical\nsource used to excite the coils that produce the mag-\nnetic field. Completing this system is a transmitter,\nwhich is a specially designed voltmeter, or more\nrecently may include a microprocessor. The transmit-\nter converts the low-level generated voltage to a us-\nable output signal for flow-rate indication, totalization,\nor control.\nIn practice, voltage is sensed by two electrodes\nmounted in the same plane, but directly across an\nelectrically insulated section of pipe. Since its inven-\ntion in the late 1930s, the electromagnetic flow meter\nhas been extensively developed. The developments\ninclude DC coil energization and weighted magnetic\nfields. More recent emphasis has been on coil design\nto reduce the size and power consumption of the flow\nmeters, which has been about 20 to 30 watts.\nElectromagnetic flow meters typically provide accuracy\nof between 0.5 and 1.0 percent of actual over a wide\nrange. As long as a minimum electrical conductivity is\npresent in the measured fluid, volumetric flow rate is\nmeasured without interference from entrapped solids.\n(11) Ultrasonic flow meters\nUltrasonic meters, like many modern meters, were\ninitially oversold. A particular problem is convincing\nusers that the two basic systems using ultrasonic\nwaves, the Doppler and the transit time meters, oper-\nate on completely different principles. The modern\nclamp-on transit-time meter can indicate flow rate to\nbetter than plus or minus 2 percent of actual, depend-\ning on design. The Doppler meters usually indicate\nplus or minus 5 percent. A major advantage of ultra-\nsonic methods is the negligible head loss and the\nability to install either portable or dedicated systems\nwithout line shutdown.\nAs mentioned, ultrasonics are applied to flow metering\nin two basic ways. This results in two basic meter\ntypes: transmission and reflection (Doppler). The\ntransmission type establishes a sound path through\nthe liquid in the pipe or channel. The reflection type\ndepends on particles in the fluid that can reflect sound\nto the receiver, and is really just another way to detect\nparticles in the flow. Sonic signals are about 100,000\ncycles per second.\nA major disadvantage of externally mounted ultrasonic\nmeters is the need to know exact inside pipe diameter\nand inside wall surface condition. Ultrasonic meters\nwork best on noncorrosive pipe materials unless the\ncorrosion or built-up material (scale) can be deter-\nmined. Calibration on a similar pipeline and known\nflow rate is recommended to compensate for these\nuncertainties.\nProper operation of both transit time and Doppler\nultrasonic flow meters require:\n• Acoustic contact between transducer face and\npipe so the ultrasonic signal can be injected into\nthe pipe. Machine grease or silicon grease can be\nused, or silicon rubber can be used if the device\nis to be permanently installed.\n• The system should not be used with partially full\npipes. The sensed velocity may be correct, but\nthe flow area generally is wrong.\n• The mounting of the transducer must be parallel\nto the axis of flow. The extreme top or bottom of\nhorizontal pipe walls should not be used. This\nhelps avoid problems with bubbles (top) or\nbedload sediment (bottom).",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nIrrigation Water Management\tChapter 9\n9–222 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\n(i) \tUltrasonic transit time (time-of-flight)\nmeters—The ideal flow meter is one that can be\ninstalled on the outside of a pipe, but can give the\nperformance of the best flow meters installed inside\nthe line. Ultrasonic transit time meters have been\ndeveloped toward these apparently conflicting but\ndemanding criteria. Multiple beam, single path, sys-\ntems have been installed on many pipelines, the most\nnotable of which is the Alaskan oil pipeline. Single\npath transit time ultrasonic meters require a transmit-\nter/receiver on opposite sides of a pipeline. With\ndouble path meters, only one side of the pipeline is\nused. A reflective path (one-sided) ultrasonic transit\ntime meter reflects the sonic signal off the opposite\ninside wall of the pipeline. With both types, good\ncontact must be made between the transmitter/re-\nceiver and outside pipeline wall. Both types send a\nsonic signal across the flow area at a 20 to 45 degree\nangle to the flow velocity.\nThese meters are popular for measurement of flows in\nlarge pipelines. Many transit time meters can be used\non pipelines as small as 2 inches in diameter. They\nhave also been used in some open canal systems. The\nflow must be relatively free of suspended materials\nthat could reflect and spread the sonic energy. In pipes\nthat are more than 3 feet in diameter, four paths\nacross the full pipe are commonly used. The meters\nare relatively expensive and require an electric power\nsource and trained technicians for assured operation.\nUltrasonic transit time flow meters require at least two\ntransmitters and two receivers. Two sound paths are\nestablished in the fluid, usually along the same diago-\nnal path, but in opposite directions. On one path, the\nsound travels with the direction of fluid flow (at an\nangle across the flow). On the other, the sound moves\nagainst the direction of fluid flow. The motion of the\nfluid causes a frequency or phase shift in each path,\nwhich is measured and converted to fluid velocity.\n(ii) Ultrasonic, reflective type Doppler meter—\nThe Doppler, or reflective type, meter developed to\nmeasure effluent flow also works on a frequency shift\nprinciple. The frequency shift occurs in the sound\nreflected from particles that are presumed to be mov-\ning at the same velocity as the fluid itself. Latest ver-\nsions claim to operate with particle sizes below 100\nmicron and at a concentration of 100 parts per million\nor less. With the Doppler reflective type meter, only\none transmitter and one receiver located on the same\nside of the pipeline are used. The sonic signal is re-\nflected off the opposite inside pipeline wall. Sonic flow\npath is perpendicular to the pipeline centerline.\nDoppler theory in this application is based on the\nassumption that the doppler shift is inversely propor-\ntional to the velocity of the particles in the liquid.\n(iii) Ultrasonic meter for irrigation flow mea-\nsurements—A particular exception to high cost and\nlack of ruggedness usually associated with ultrasonic\ntransit time flow meters may be a recently introduced\ndevice designed for measuring both flow rate and total\nflow in irrigation pipelines that are flowing full. Badger\nMeter, Inc., sold the particular units observed to the\nNew Magma Irrigation District, Central Arizona Irriga-\ntion and Drainage District, and Maricopa-Standfield\nIrrigation District, all in Arizona. They were put into\nservice during the fall of 1986. (Use of brand names is\nfor the reader’s reference and information and does\nnot constitute endorsement by the author or USDA,\nNRCS.)\nCalled the Model 4420 Compusonic meter, it is a\ntransit time, single path, ultrasonic flow meter. It uses\nbattery power with solar panel recharging, and is\nmicroprocessor controlled to allow a sleep/wake-up\nmode to conserve power. It has two LCD displays, one\nthree-digit display for flow rate and a six-digit display\nfor totalized flow volume. It is programmable in BASIC\nto particular units. A serial communications port\nallows accumulated flow data to be dumped to a data\nlogger. The meter has two internal totalizers. One\ncannot be reset and is displayed continuously. The\nother totalizer can be temporarily displayed in its\nplace and can be reset to zero. Flow rate readings can\nbe obtained by manual activation. Because of pipeline\nflow turbulence, 3 to 5 readings averaged over a 10-\nminute are recommended for best accuracy.\nSonic sensors are installed about 100 feet downstream\nfrom circular slide gates in pipes that are about 2 feet\nin diameter. Most of the pipelines are slightly curved.\nSonic sensors are premounted on a stainless steel\ncircular band that is inserted into the pipe immediately\nupstream of the outlet. The outlet is installed below\nthe grade of the farm lateral it supplies, so the irriga-\ntion district pipeline stands full of water between\ndeliveries. This should inhibit growth of crystals on\nthe sensor faces. Sensors sample a single horizontal\npath across the pipe for 16 seconds every 15 minutes,",

Best accuracy is claimed\nfor flow velocities in excess of 0.5 foot per second, but\ndetection of flow is practical at velocities as small as\n0.1 foot per second. The angle of the single path beam\nis at 22 degrees across the pipe. Field checks against\nReplogle broadcrested weirs showed good agreement\nwithin less than plus or minus 3 percent for the four\nlocations tested.\n(12) Other measuring devices\nOther meters or measuring devices having limited\napplication to measuring irrigation flows are available.\nThey are mentioned primarily as examples that meters\nexist using one or more of the common physical\nprinciples. Others are so uncomplicated as to require\nlittle explanation. For example a volume meter, which\ncan consist of a calibrated container and stopwatch,\ncan be used to measure flows from sprinkler heads,\nsiphon tubes, or other small diameter conduits that\nhave water flowing in a free-fall condition. Rotameters\nare sometimes used to monitor chemicals being me-\ntered into irrigation flows, such as for chemigation\nwith pressurized irrigation systems. Many of these\nsimple measuring procedures are described with\napplicable irrigation system evaluation procedures\nearlier in this chapter. Several open channel measuring\ndevices are commercially manufactured in reduced\nsizes to provide small portable flow measuring devices\nfor small channels or furrows. These devices include\norifice plates, v-notch weirs, Replogle flumes, v-notch\nflumes, H-flumes, and Palmer-Bowles flumes.",

Con-\nservation management systems consider the total farm\nor ranch environment, including the watershed,\nairshed, and environment in which it exists. Conserva-\ntion management can involve one or more resource\nmanagement systems. Irrigation system planning must\nconsider the potential interactive effect on SWAPA\nresources plus how an action may affect the onsite\nand offsite human environment. An irrigation sys-\ntem plan is a component of an overall farm con-\nservation plan. Irrigation system planning includes:\n• Sustaining or improving soil condition\n(includes productivity)\n• Maintaining or improving surface and ground\nwater quality and quantity\n• Wise use of limited water supplies\n• Providing a condition healthful for growing\nplants without degrading other resources\n• Consideration of domestic animals and wildlife\n• Impacts on soil erosion and deposition\n• Consideration of human needs\nConservation irrigation planning requires the develop-\nment of conservation management systems. An con-\nservation management system is a combination of\nconservation practices that when installed and main-\ntained will protect the SWAPA resource base. Included\nare meeting tolerable soil losses, maintaining accept-\nable water quality, conserving limited water supplies,\nproviding equal or greater returns, and maintaining\nacceptable ecological and management levels for the\nselected use. Conservation management systems also\ninclude conservation practices that improve the qual-\nity of the environment and standard of living of those\nliving on the land. To an irrigator this can mean reduc-\ning water and energy use, controlling erosion, improv-\ning crop yield, improving product quality, and main-\ntaining productivity of the land.\nThe art and science of planning involve working\nclosely with the irrigation decisionmaker to under-\nstand objectives and concerns and to identify resource\nproblems. This requires a resource inventory to de-\nvelop the foundation on which to base alternative\nconservation management systems. Alternatives must\nbe presented to the user in such a way that details can\nbe easily understood and informed decisions can be\nmade. Implementation requires quality and detailed\nplans. Installation of an irrigation system and compo-\nnents should be completed according to these plans.\nDaily management, operation, and maintenance of the\nirrigation system must be included in the plan with\ncosts and benefits identified.\nPlanning is a continuing process, not an end product\nin itself. Planning has value only if implemented. A\ncooperator’s objectives change as do economic condi-\ntions. Follow-up assistance may be required to address\nthese changes and to make adjustments in conserva-\ntion resource management. Even with detailed plan-\nning and design, most irrigation related recommenda-\ntions are estimates and must be adjusted under actual\nfield conditions. The management plan must take\nthese factors into account.",

The plan is the result of a joint effort\nbetween the consultant, owner, operator, and the\nirrigation decisionmaker in which technical knowl-\nedge and experience are pooled. An irrigation plan\nfollows the nine steps of planning (NRCS National\nPlanning Procedures Handbook) and encompasses all\naspects of planning on irrigated land. The plan in-\ncludes determining the water user’s objectives and\nproblems, SWAPA resource inventories, alternative\nanalysis, and decisionmaking. Irrigation system opera-\ntion and maintenance plans are a part of irrigation\nsystem planning. Coordination with cropping system\nplans, irrigation system plans, drainage plans, irriga-\ntion water management plans, and follow-up plans is\nessential.\n(a) Written plans\nWritten documentation is essential for use by the\ndecisionmaker. Documentation of the irrigation plan\nshould be used in decisionmaking processes and as a\nguide to carry out the plan. Irrigation plan documenta-\ntion may be presented as one document or, more\nlikely, as several documents over a period of time\ndepending on the stage of planning.\nWritten documentation should be thoroughly dis-\ncussed with and understood by the decisionmaker.\nThe type and amount of information that must be\npresented and when the information is needed have a\nbearing on the form of written documentation. The\nminimum content of the plan is up to the professional\njudgment of the persons (consultant and decision-\nmaker) preparing the plan. The desires of the decision-\nmaker should always be reflected. As a minimum, the\nplan should identify irrigation scheduling methods and\nthe chosen method, the irrigation system to be used,\nand an operation and maintenance plan.\nThe individual(s) preparing the plan must decide the\namount of detail that planning should involve and the\ncontent of written plan documents. Information given\nto the decisionmaker must be clearly understood,\nusable, and not cluttered with unneeded material.\n(b) Degree of planning\nIrrigation planning can be complex, involving environ-\nmental assessments and impacts, agronomy, soil,\nanimal husbandry, engineering, economics, ecology,\nand farm and ranch management. On the other hand, it\ncan be direct, addressing only one concern and its\neffect on the environment. Plan preparation and con-\ntent should be based on the irrigation decisionmaker’s\nneeds and identified resource concerns.\nAn conservation planning process considers the farm,\nranch, or community as a whole even if the decision-\nmaker is interested in only one field or practice. This\ncan ensure that delivery system components of pipe-\nlines and ditches are an adequate size and elevation to\nservice all the unit. Should operators choose not to\nsize a pipeline or ditch for the expanded system, they\nshould understand the pipeline or ditch may need to\nbe enlarged or supplemented when the current irriga-\ntion system is expanded. The conservation planning\nprocess also helps assure the irrigation operation fits\ninto the rest of the farm or ranch operation. The total\nfarm water supply (rate, volume, and availability)\nshould be inventoried to help assure proper irrigation\nin the selected area.\nImplementation of the irrigation plan may begin with\none field, one ditch, or one pipeline and may continue\nfor several years. Revisions may be needed because of\nthe constantly changing farm economy and changing\nclient objectives.\nClients may have strong feelings about certain irriga-\ntion methods or systems. Even so, they deserve infor-\nmation on the best available systems and management\ntechniques that will meet both their needs and those of\nthe site. Pros and cons, including labor and economic\nconsiderations, of the best fit systems need to be\nprovided. The decisionmaker can then make an in-\nformed choice from alternatives presented.\nOften the irrigation water user wants technical help,\ncost share, or both, on a single practice. A planner’s\nskill is reflected in how well the opportunity is used to",

Include irrigation scheduling\nmethods appropriate for the user.\nStep 6 Evaluate alternatives—Consider potential\nenvironmental impacts, costs, and on-farm labor and\nskill availability.\nStep 7 Water user decision—Which irrigation\nmethod, system, and components to use; and, overall\nwater management desires.\nStep 8 Water user implements irrigation plan.\nStep 9 Followup—Evaluating results of plan imple-\nmentation, onsite and offsite.

One of the best ways to do this is to walk\nthe fields to be planned with the user. Look around,\nlook at the next field, dig or auger some holes, use a\nprobe, check root development of previous crops, talk\nabout what you see, and listen. Expand the inquiry\nbeyond the boundary of the original request for assis-\ntance. If the request was for a specific practice or\nirrigation system component, what thought was given\nto how the practice fits into overall resource conserva-\ntion operations?\nAsk the water user what the objectives, concerns, and\nproblems are. (Problems may be real or perceived.)\nConsider how individual actions within one resource\nimpact other resources, both onsite and offsite. Iden-\ntify planning objectives for each resource of concern.\nEncourage the user to make these objectives a part of\nthe irrigation plan. Objectives can include:\n• Protecting the soil from excessive erosion\n• Maintaining or improving community water\nquality\n• Reducing dependency upon selected farm\nchemicals\n• Sustaining productivity of soil to grow plants\n• Conserving water where supply is limited, and\nwise use of water where supply is not limited\n• Promoting fish and wildlife habitat\n• Reducing energy use\n• Identify the true decisionmaker involved in day-\nto-day (and perhaps hourly) decisions concern-\ning operation of the irrigation system. The deci-\nsionmaker can be the owner, operator, or the\nirrigator. Typically all three (even if one person\nfills all three roles) are involved and should be a\npart of the planning process.\n(b) Resource inventory and\nanalysis of data\nThe soil, water, air, plant, and animal resource inven-\ntory is an information collection process. It provides\ninformation needed to prepare the irrigation plan. The\nfirst phase, the resource inventory, is performed\nduring the field visit as part of the previous step. Then\ndata must be analyzed. Some of the more important\nresource data required for planning are soils, crops,\ntopography, water supply, existing physical features,\nexisting irrigation systems, water table presence,\nexisting drainage systems, environmental factors,\npresent farm operation, skill and labor available,\noperators desires and concerns, and energy resources.\n(1) Soils\nThe soil survey, where available, is a prime source for\nsoils information. The survey gives a good indication\nof what can be expected in a specific field; however, it\ngenerally is not in great enough detail to provide all\ninformation needed for detailed planning and design\non irrigated cropland, hayland, or pasture land. Addi-\ntional field investigation is generally necessary to\nidentify actual surface soil texture(s) and plant root\nzone volume.\nOn alluvial fans the action of flowing water has re-\nsulted in many soil inclusions and variations within\nfields. Observation of crops and soil color sometimes\ngives a clue as to soil differences. The irrigator may be\nable to identify some of the soil problems. With use of\na hand auger, and a little experience, planners can gain\nenough information about soils based on their own\nfield investigations to do an adequate job of planning.\nNever assume a plant root zone depth. Excavate a 12-\nto 18-inch-deep pit or use a soil auger to observe (and\nmeasure) onsite root development patterns and\ndepths.\nNearly all soils are affected by field equipment caused\ncompaction. Compaction, especially tillage pans, can\nlimit plant root development and water measurement.\nOverirrigation can also limit root development pat-\nterns. An otherwise deep soil responds as a shallow\nsoil if root zone volumes are limited by cultural prac-\ntices on that field. Onsite cultural practices often limit\nroot development to the soil volume above a tillage\npan.\nCritical data, such as available water capacity and\nintake rates, may require taking tests on soils in spe-\ncific fields. These parameters vary even within the\nsame soil series. Judgment must be used by the plan-\nner in determining how reliable existing data are and if\nadditional detail surveying and testing are needed.\nOther basic considerations include crop rooting\ndepths, soil salinity and sodicity, soil acidity, presence\nof a water table, drainage problems, erosion and\nsedimentation problems, and soil condition.",

Net irrigation requirement and frequency\nof irrigation need to be determined based on soils and\ncrops grown and the amount of risk the owner wishes\nto assume. Determine what crop yields and product\nquality have been typical in the past. Find out from the\nwater user what cultural practices have been used.\nThey may include cultivation sequence, equipment\nused, width of equipment (cultivators, haying equip-\nment), crop varieties, fertilizer usage and time of\napplication, crop rotations, and planting and harvest\ndates. Discuss crops and cultural practices that might\nbe used in a planned cropping system.\n(3) Topography\nDetermine high and low points in each field and the\ndirection of irrigation for surface irrigation and sur-\nface drainage. Simple bench level surveys may be\nrequired to obtain spot elevations. A detailed topo-\ngraphic or grid survey is expedient for selecting alter-\nnatives for detailed planning and design of specific\nirrigation systems and determining if intensive land\nleveling or reorganization is needed. A detailed topo-\ngraphic map is often necessary for planning and de-\nsigning micro and low pressure sprinkler irrigation\nsystems. Small changes in elevation can have large\neffects on irrigation uniformity when using low pres-\nsure irrigation systems.\n(4) Water supply\nDetermine flow rate (when available), source location,\nand elevation of water supply. Water quality, including\nchemical content, sediment, and debris loads also\nneed to be determined. Quality of runoff water from\nupstream irrigators can determine its suitability for\nuse on certain crops. Runoff water may contain cer-\ntain pesticides and their metabolites, nutrients (i.e.,\nphosphorous) and sediment.\nTailwater recovery and reuse should be a consider-\nation where allowed by local water regulations. It may\nbe necessary to obtain laboratory tests for chemical\ncontent and to measure water supply flow rates.\nIf an irrigation company or district is involved, deter-\nmine their delivery schedule. Amount of lift (depth to\nwater table with drawdown) and costs while pumping\nare factors when using wells. Water costs and pump-\ning costs can be major factors in any cost-benefit\nanalysis.\n(5) Existing physical features\nDetermine access to all parts of the irrigated area and\nlocation of access roads, aboveground utilities, buried\nutilities, and other physical features. Depth to buried\nutilities may control excavation location and depths.\nAboveground utilities may limit the use and layout of\nsprinkler systems (pivot and linear move systems,\nside-roll wheel lines, traveling gun types). Use aerial\nphotographs and maps as plan base maps and add\nsketches or overlays.\n(6) Existing irrigation systems\nAn analysis of the existing irrigation method and\nsystem, including management, helps to determine if\nthe present system is appropriate for the resources\ninvolved. Improving management using the existing\nsystem is always the first component of improved\nwater application. Too often the perception exists that\nto improve water application a new or different irriga-\ntion system must be installed. Installing a new irriga-\ntion system to improve water application efficiency is\nnot only costly, but often unnecessary. Water applica-\ntion efficiency improvements are usually limited to 5\nto 10 percent increase over using proper water man-\nagement with the existing system. Using proper water\nmanagement with the existing system often results in\nincreasing water application efficiency more than 30\npercent.\nAfter a thorough analysis of water management prac-\ntices used, make an inventory of the existing system.\nGather data on equipment brands, models, and capaci-\nties. Perform a simple irrigation system analysis or a\ndetailed system analysis if needed. The water user may\nhave some strong feelings about certain irrigation\nmethods and systems. Users deserve information on\nthe best available method and systems that meet their\nneeds and are most suitable for the site. Pros and\ncons, including labor requirement and costs of a best\nfit system, need to be provided.\n(7) Water table presence\nDetermine availability, depth, duration, type of buried\nconduit system (where it exists), water quality, and if\nthe water table can provide either part or all the crop\nwater needs.",

Include condition of existing ditches and\nunderground drains, sources of water, and problems\ncreated by poor drainage. Determine if poor drainage\nis the result of mismanagement or natural causes.\nOverirrigation is by far the greatest water management\nproblem where water supplies are adequate.\n(9) Environmental factors\nAmong many resources, wetland areas within the\nplanning area must be identified and assessed. Pos-\nsible water pollution sources need to be identified, and\nfloodplain hazard needs to be evaluated. This inven-\ntory process and environmental effects can be facili-\ntated by use of exhibit 10–1, environmental effects for\nresource management plan (Exhibit 5, Part 600.7,\nNRCS National Planning Procedures Handbook).\n(10) Present farm operation\nFind out about the overall mix of farm enterprises and\nhow the irrigated crops fit into the total farm manage-\nment system. Determine the amount and skill of labor\navailable. As irrigation systems become more auto-\nmated and computerized, higher level of operation and\nmanagement skills are necessary. Observe the level of\npresent farm management. It is unlikely a less than\nadequate manager will suddenly assume high manage-\nment skills and desires.\n(11) Operator's desires and concerns\nDetermine operator’s objectives, desires, and con-\ncerns. Ask the water user about desires and concerns,\nand listen to the answers. Are desires based on fact,\nperception, or what the neighbor has?\n(12) Energy resources\nDetermine the availability and unit costs of electrical\npower. This should include power company policies\nconcerning new installations, standby charges, de-\nmand charges, and minimum charges. Diesel, natural\ngas, or gasoline engines for powering pumps can be\nmore cost effective especially where most or part of\nthe seasonal crop water requirements is met by pre-\ncipitation. Estimate efficiency of the existing power\nequipment. Consider the need for total pumping plant\nevaluations. Investigate the potential for gravity flow\nsystems.",

Work through the most promising\nalternatives just to the extent needed to determine\nfeasibility. Refine the most feasible alternatives, and\ndocument them in enough detail that water user can\nselect the alternative that best meets the defined needs\nand desires. The most promising alternatives generally\nrequire at least a cost estimate and may require an\neconomic analysis. The alternatives must be thor-\noughly discussed with the water user at the time\ndocumentation is presented and discussed.\nAlternatives considered should meet all requirements\nof an conservation management system, the FOTG,\nand the objectives of the water user. An conservation\nmanagement system on irrigated land may include one\nor more of the following practices and measures:\nIrrigation method:\n• Surface—Level and graded systems including\nborder, basin, furrow, rill, corrugation, contour\nlevee, contour furrow, and contour ditch.\n• Sprinkle—Periodic move, fixed (solid) set, gun\ntype, and continuous (self) move (center pivot or\nlinear move including LEPA and LPIC, and gun\ntype).\n• Micro—Line source, point source, basin bubbler,\nand minispray.\n• Subirrigation—Water table control.\nIrrigation water management:\n• How will the need to irrigate (when and how\nmuch) be determined?\n• What irrigation system adjustments can be made\nto increase or decrease application?\nIrrigation system distribution components:\n• Irrigation field ditches\n• Pipelines (surface and buried)\n• Structure for water control (including measuring\ndevices)\n• Irrigation water conveyance, ditch, and canal\nlining\n• Irrigation system tailwater recovery and reuse\n• Irrigation land leveling, grading, and smoothing\n• Irrigation pit or regulating reservoir\n• Irrigation storage reservoir\n• Water table control\n• Well\nDrainage system:\n• Controlled drainage\n• Subsurface drain\n• Surface drainage\n• Irrigation tailwater disposal\nConservation cropping sequence:\n• Crop residue use\n• Conservation tillage\n• Pasture and hayland management\n• Field windbreaks\n• Nutrient management\n• Pest management\n• Pumping plant for water control\n• Wildlife wetland habitat management\nOther:\n• Access road\n• Field arrangement\n• Obstruction removal\nWater budget or balance\nA representative or specific water budget or balance\ntaken from the FOTG or developed for the specific\nfarm can be displayed in table or graph form.

Where daily crop water use data are\navailable, the more detailed water balance can display\neffects of water availability, nutrient and pesticide\napplication, and management. For design and manage-\nment purposes, the field water balance can be written\nmathematically as:\nF \tET \tD \tSDL \tRO \tP \tGW \tSW\tg \tc \tP\t= \t+ \t+ \t+ \t− \t− \t− ∆\nwhere:\nFg \t= gross water required during the period\nET c \t= crop evapotranspiration during the period\nDp \t= deep percolation from the crop root zone\nduring the period\nSDL \t= spray and drift losses from irrigation water\nin air and evaporation from plant canopies\nduring the period\nRO \t= surface runoff that leaves the field during the\nperiod\nP \t= total precipitation during the period\nGW \t= ground water contribution to the crop root\nzone during the period\n∆SW = change in soil water in the crop root zone\nduring the period (this may be plus or minus)\nNote: The above equation provides for all losses when\ncomputing F g. If net application (F n) is used instead of\ngross application (Fg), then losses would be estimated\nby using overall irrigation efficiency (IE).\n(d) Decisions and implementation\nAfter decisions are made by the water user, they need\nto be documented. Technical assistance required for\nimplementation and followup can be tentatively identi-\nfied. Definite decisions for irrigation method and type\nof system, system components, and operation and\nmanagement practices are essential, but timing of\nimplementation is sometimes not totally predictable.\n652.1003 \tIrrigation sys-\ntem, operation, and water\nmanagement plan\nOnce decisions are made regarding the irrigation\nmethod and system to be used, a detailed irrigation\nsystem installation plan along with operation and\nmanagement plans can be prepared. These parts of the\noverall irrigation plan may include engineering draw-\nings, specifications, resource data, quantity estimates,\nand other data needed by the water user to implement,\noperate, maintain, and properly manage the selected\nirrigation system.

It may include\nsuch practices as:\n• Conservation cropping sequence\n• Crop residue use\n• Conservation tillage system\n• Mulching\n• Chiseling and subsoiling\n• Cover and green manure crops\n• Toxic salt reduction\n• Contour farming\n• Nutrient management\n• Pest management",

As in other parts of the\noverall irrigation plan, irrigation system improvements\nare often designed and installed in stages. When this is\nthe case, enough design must be done initially on the\noverall system to assure that all the subsequently\ninstalled components operate satisfactorily when the\ncomplete system is installed and operating.\nConstruction drawings and specifications should be\ntailored to the user to some degree. Drawings should\nbe neat, complete, and professional. Depending on\nskill and construction experience of the water user or\ncontractor, more detail, including more drawings, may\nbe needed on how to do the job.\nDetails of the drawings and specifications must be\nreviewed with each water user at the time the plans\nand specifications are provided. This will help ensure\nthat there is full understanding of what is to be in-\nstalled and how it is to be done. The water user can\nalso be an important part of the construction inspec-\ntion process where NRCS or a consultant does not\nprovide full time inspection.\nAn irrigation system operations plan is a part of every\nirrigation system applications plan. The operating plan\nshould detail how the system is to be operated includ-\ning: charging and draining the system, opening and\nclosing valves, winterizing motors, engines, and\npumps, and making application rate changes.\n(c) Irrigation water management\nplan\nThe irrigation water management plan covers the\ndetails needed to manage the irrigation system. Such\ndetails may include the following information.\n• How fast the soil absorbs water (intake and\napplication rates), including how to determine\nwhen adjustments are necessary and how to\nmake the needed adjustments.\n• The operations plan should detail how they\nsystem is to be operated including: changing and\ndraining the system operating and closing valves;\nwinterizing motors, engines, and pumps; and\nmaking application rate changes.\n• The method for determining when (frequency)\nand how much water (normal depth of applica-\ntion per irrigation) to apply. This information is\nbased on peak period use rate and on soil water\ncontent or plant water use (stress) levels. The\npeak period use rate should include enough\nwater to meet the use rate for all months during\nthe irrigation season. The following basic equa-\ntion is applicable:\nQ T = D A\nwhere:\nQ \t= flow rate (ft3/s)\nT \t= time (hr)\nD \t= depth of application (in)\nA \t= area (acres)\nA useful relationship for converting flow rate to\ndepth of application is:\n1 ft 3/s for 1 hr = 1 in depth over 1 acre\nor\n1 ft3/s = 24 ac-in/d\nor\n1 ft3/s = 2 ac-ft/d\n• Know the relationship between gross irrigation\ndepth and the net irrigation depth for each field.\n• Recommend design flow rates, how to measure\nflows, effects of advance times, how to make\nadjustments, and irrigation set times for\nborders, levees, furrows, sprinklers, and micro\nsystem emitters, bubblers, or hose. For example,\nmisapplying adjustment in flow and set time for\neliminating or reducing runoff may inadvertently\nincrease deep percolation. Flow measurement is\na primary management tool along with being a\nregulation tool.\n• Details of irrigation scheduling method and how\nto prepare a day to day schedule, accounting for\neffective precipitation, automation setting and\nadjustment, and computerized scheduling.\n• How to check field for adequacy of irrigation.\n• Guidelines for self-evaluation of irrigation effec-\ntiveness.\n• Know cost of each irrigation and anticipated\nbenefits.",

Different irrigation\nscheduling methods, soil-water content determination\nprocedures, flow measurement procedures, and pros\nand cons of different set times should all have been\nthoroughly discussed and perhaps demonstrated. The\nfinal written management plan should contain details on\nprocedures selected by the irrigation decisionmaker. All\nirrigation application amounts, set time, and scheduling\nperiods are estimates. Procedures must be provided for\nmaking adjustments in frequency, quantities, and times\nof application. Every water user has a different learning\nlevel, operation and management desire, and skill level.\nThe planner must develop an accurate feel for the level\nof irrigation water management appropriate for the\nindividual water user. Remember a below average\nmanager will seldom become an above average manager\novernight.\n(d) Installation\nInstallations of the irrigation system, system compo-\nnents, and agronomic practices need technical sup-\nport. Planning and design are of no value if practices\nare not installed, operated, and managed properly.\nSufficient time for technical assistance needs to be\nprovided to ensure that the job is done right. Consider\nall sources of installation technical assistance includ-\ning farm consultants, irrigation dealers, and private\nengineers.\nOperation and management of irrigation by the water\nuser are much easier and less time consuming if plan-\nning was thorough. This includes working closely with\nthe water user to assure documentation is complete\nand has been thoroughly explained and discussed.\n(e) Maintenance\nMaintenance of the irrigation system and all compo-\nnents is essential for satisfactory long-term economi-\ncal operation. Maintenance items need to be presented\nand discussed in the irrigation plan. This includes:\n• Annual (or between crops) laser leveling or\ngrading of surface irrigated fields\n• Maintenance of pump, well, valves, and pipeline\n• Replacement of worn or malfunctioning sprin-\nkler/spray nozzles and heads, and micro emitter\ndevices.\n(f) Followup and evaluation\nPlanned followup is essential for an irrigation plan\nbecause soil, water, and crop conditions change.\nAdjustments must be made in management of the\nsystem. Data and technical design procedures rely\nupon best available and average values, which are\nnever fully accurate, to make absolute predictions of\nhow irrigation systems will function. Typically, some\ntechnical help is needed to make adjustments. All\nsources of followup and evaluation technical assis-\ntance should be considered. The need for adjustments\nduring system use needs to be fully explained to the\nwater user during the planning process.",

The preceding irrigation schedule can be used as a\nguide to determine when to irrigate. It is a guide only for average month and year conditions. Optimizing use of rainfall to\nreduce unnecessary irrigations during the growing season is a good management practice. In semi-humid and humid areas, it\nis recommended to not replace 100 percent of the soil moisture depletion each irrigation. Leave room in the plant root zone\nfor containing water infiltration from rainfall events. This will vary with location, frequency, and amount of rainfall occurring\nduring the growing season. It should be approximately 0.5 to 1.0 inches.\nMaintaining to a higher soil moisture level (MAD) typically does not require more irrigation water for the season, just more\nfrequent smaller irrigations. This is especially true with crops such as root vegetables, potatoes, onions, garlic, mint, and\nsweet corn.\nThe attached chart for evaluating soil moisture by the feel and appearance method can be used to help determine when to\nirrigate. Other common methods to monitor crop water use and soil moisture include: plant signs (crop critical moisture stress\nperiods), atmometer, evaporation pan (applying appropriate factors), tensiometers, electrical resistance blocks (moisture\nblocks), and crop water stress index (CWSI gm).\nNRCS (SCS) - SCHEDULER computer software is available to provide calculations of daily crop evapotranspiration when\nused with local daily weather station values. On-site rainfall data is necessary to determine effective rainfall, whereas local\nweather station rainfall data is not sufficiently accurate due to spatial variability. Current rainfall and soil moisture data can be\ninput manually or electronically to assist in predicting when irrigation is needed.",

Your system\nwas designed and installed to apply irrigation water to meet the needs of the crop without causing erosion, runoff,\nand losses to deep percolation. The estimated life span of your system is 15 years. The life of the system can be\nassured and usually increased by developing and carrying out a good operation and maintenance program.\nPollution hazards to ground and surface water can be minimized when good irrigation water management practices\nare followed. Losses of irrigation water to deep percolation and runoff should be minimized. Deep percolation and\nrunoff from irrigation can carry nutrients and pesticides into ground and surface water. Avoiding spills from agricul-\ntural chemicals, fuels, and lubricants. will also minimize potential pollution hazards to ground and surface water.\nLeaching for salinity control may be required if electrical conductivity of the irrigation water or soil water exceeds\nplant tolerance for your yield and quality objectives. If this condition exists on your field(s), a salinity management\nplan should be developed.\nThe following are system design information and recommendations to help you develop an operation and mainte-\nnance plan (see irrigation system map for layout):\n• \taverage operating pressure = \t38 \tlb/in2 (use a pressure gage to check operating pressure)\n• \tnozzle size = \t13/64 \tinch (use shank end of high speed drill bit to check nozzle wear)\n• \taverage sprinkler head discharge \t7.2 \tgpm\n• \tsprinkler head rotation speed should be 1 - 2 revolutions per minute\n• \tsprinkler head spacing on lateral = \t40 \tft; outlet valve spacing on main line 50 ft\n• \tlateral, number(s) \t2 \t, \t1,280 \tft, \t4 \tinch diameter \tside roll wheel line\n• \tmain line = \t2.600 \tft \t6 \tinch diameter, type \tPVC \t, class \t160 lb/in2\n• \tpump = 30 hp electric , \t475 \tgpm @ \t175 \tft Total Dynamic Head (TDH)\nMake sure that all measuring devices, valves, sprinkler heads, surface pipeline, and other mechanical parts of the\nsystem are checked periodically and worn or damaged parts are replaced as needed. Always replace a worn or\nimproperly functioning nozzle with design size and type. Sprinkler heads operate efficiently and provide uniform\napplication when they are plumb, in good operating condition, and operate at planned pressure. Maintain all\npumps, piping, valves, electrical and mechanical equipment in accordance with manufacturer recommendations.\nCheck and clean screens and filters as necessary to prevent unnecessary hydraulic friction loss and to maintain\nwater flow necessary for efficient pump operation.\nProtect pumping plant and all associated electrical and mechanical controls from damage by livestock, rodents,\ninsects, heat, water, lightning, sudden power failure, and sudden water source loss. Provide and maintain good\nsurface drainage to prevent water pounding around pump and electrical equipment. Assure all electrical/gas fittings\nare secure and safe. Always replace worn or excessively weathered electric cables and wires and gas tubing and\nfittings when first noticed. Check periodically for undesirable stray currents and leaks. Display appropriate bilingual\noperating instructions and warning signs as necessary. During non-seasonal use, drain pipelines and valves,\nsecure and protect all movable equipment (i.e. wheel lines).\nIf you need help developing your operation and maintenance plan, contact your local USDA Natural Resources\nConservation Service office for assistance.\nU.S. Department of Agriculture \tPage 3 of 3\nNatural Resources Conservation Service\nIrrigation Water Management Plan—Sprinkler Irrigation System—Continued\nNAME \tJ.P.

It is intended\nprimarily to illustrate for field office personnel the use\nof economic principles and evaluation procedures.\nThese principles and procedures should be helpful\nwhen working with land users analyzing the econom-\nics of irrigation. Additional help is available from\ntechnical specialists. For an expanded discussion of\neconomic evaluations, see The Handbook of Econom-\nics for Conservation, Natural Resources Conservation\nService (NRCS), April 1992, and Farm Management\nCourse Notebook, NRCS and America Society of Farm\nManagers and Appraisers, 1994.\n652.1101 \tGeneral\nDecisions are made daily whether to purchase an item\nor which item to purchase. Economics is the process\nof deciding where and how we spend our money\nranging from pennies to thousands of dollars. There-\nfore, what factors do we analyze in deciding how to\nspend our money? Normally we compare the benefits\nof the purchase or investment to its cost. Someone\nconsidering the purchase of a new car might see better\ngas mileage and fewer repairs as benefits. Costs might\ninclude higher car payments and higher insurance\npremiums. Someone wanting a new computer might\nbe comparing benefits that a new computer would give\nthem in business and at home to the cost of giving up\nother activities or items currently enjoyed.\nFarmers, when deciding whether to purchase an\nirrigation system, go through much the same thought\nprocess. They may ask, “Should I continue my dryland\nfarming operation or should I irrigate? If I decide to\nirrigate, how much water should be applied to get the\ngreatest profit? Will the greatest profit be realized at\nthe point of maximum yield? Will the increase in yield\nmore than pay the increase in costs?”\nThese questions can be asked when contemplating\nwhether to replace an existing irrigation system. What\nare the proposed changes? What are the costs? What\nare the benefits? Is there a better alternative? For\nexample:\n• Improved water management with the existing\nirrigation system, or\n• Improved precipitation storage in the soil\nresulting from improved soil condition, better\ncrop residue use, changed (usually reduced)\nnumber and type of tillage operations, perform-\ning farming operations on the contour, or\n• A combination of 1 and 2.\nThe need for change should be based on using the\nexisting irrigation system along with proper water,\nsoil, and plant management. Too often a poorly man-\naged surface irrigation system is compared to a prop-\nerly managed sprinkler or micro irrigation system.\nAssumed level of management can be guided by ob-\nserving the irrigation decisionmakers current irriga-\ntion water management and other farm management",

If the water user is an average surface\nirrigation system manager, chances are he/she will be\nan average sprinkler or micro irrigation system man-\nager. Automated systems typically require higher\nlevels of management.\nExisting irrigation systems should be checked for both\nmanagement and system operational efficiencies. The\nbasis for change should include an economic evalua-\ntion of annual costs and benefits. Included are annual\noperating cost, labor availability and cost, annual cost\nof installing the existing irrigation system, and annual\nnet income using the existing irrigation system.\nThe decision to purchase an irrigation system is often\nbased on an inadequate economic analysis. Data are\nusually available or can be easily obtained to answer\nquestions in paragraph two of this section. The man-\nagement ability and performance of the operator are\nprobably the most important factors in determining\nthe feasibility of irrigation or making a change in an\nexisting irrigation system. Good water management is\nessential to realize the full benefit of irrigation. Under\npoor management a farmer will be paying the full cost\nof irrigation, but realizing only part of the benefit.\nA perception among many irrigators is that to do a\nbetter job irrigating, a different irrigation method or\nsystem must be used; i.e., convert from surface irriga-\ntion method to the sprinkle method. Often, however,\ngreater benefits can be derived with improved water\nmanagement (includes irrigation scheduling and\nsystem maintenance using the existing irrigation\nsystem). All irrigation methods (surface, sprinkle,\nmicro, and subsurface) can distribute an amount of\nwater uniformly across a field. However, site condi-\ntions for some irrigation systems can be quite limiting\nand labor requirements high. The first increment of\nchange should always be to optimize the use of\nprecipitation and irrigation water applied using\nthe existing irrigation system (if one exists).\nEach NRCS employee should be aware of the econom-\nics of irrigating in the general area and be familiar with\nthe procedure used in analyzing data to determine\nfeasibility.\nThis chapter provides tools necessary to evaluate the\nfeasibility of installing an irrigation system. These\ntools, or principles, can also be used to evaluate other\ntypes of conservation investments.\n652.1102 \tEconomics of\ninstalling a new irrigation\nsystem\nAn Economic Analysis consists of a Benefit Analysis,\nCost Analysis, and a Benefit-to-Cost Analysis. A Mar-\nginal Cost - Marginal Return Analysis can be made to\nshow the relationship per increment of change. For\nexample, per bushel of yield return or per inch of\nwater applied. Each of these components will be\ndescribed in this chapter.\n(a) Benefit analysis\nBefore installing an irrigation system, a benefit analy-\nsis should be completed to determine management\nrequirements and profitability of such an investment.\nAn irrigation system should be recommended only if it:\n• Improves the net income of the operator.\n• Reduces or favorably changes the amount,\ntiming, or type of labor required.\n• Has positive benefits on soil, water, air, plant\nand animal resources.\nSince there are four irrigation methods and many\ndifferent irrigation systems to apply water by these\nmethods, the decision becomes extremely critical in\nselecting an irrigation method and system that will\nmaximize profits while protecting the environment. To\nhelp make this determination, the water user or con-\nsultant should employ economic tools as a part of\nthe planning process to provide best management\nand system alternatives for a given water user’s\nsituation.\nThe beneficial evaluation of an irrigation system is\nusually based on the premise that production, crop\nquality, or both, will increase as a result of making\nirrigation management and system changes. This\nassumption is made with the knowledge that physical,\nchemical, and biological properties of the soil, or\nseasonal variation of temperature and the timing and\navailability of irrigation water are not a hindrance to\nincreased production or quality potential.",

Sufficient data have been\nobtained, either by research or actual field conditions,\nto develop a reliable relationship between available\nwater and yield. In reality, benefits, in addition to\nincreased yields, will probably be included in the\nevaluation. These benefits can involve higher unit\nprices for improved quality, reduced cost of operation\nper unit of product produced, and with improved\nwater management reduced water use per unit of\nproduct produced. Average yields rather than maxi-\nmum yields are recommended for cost benefit analy-\nsis. Maximum yields do not reflect negative impacts\nfrom weeds, insects, wildlife, or cool growing seasons\nthat can occur.\nThe site selected for the following example has an\naverage annual effective rainfall of 19.3 inches, of\nwhich 10 inches is considered available (effective) for\nplant use most years. Average dryland corn yield on\nthe example farm is 40 bushels per acre. Well managed\nneighboring farms, also on deep silt loam soils, apply\n16 inches of irrigation water to get an average of 170\nbushel per acre yield. Supporting data in section I of\nthe FOTG support these numbers. In the example one\nalternative will be evaluated, while in reality, several\nalternatives would most likely be evaluated. Alterna-\ntive systems could consist of different irrigation meth-\nods, different irrigation systems, automated versus\nmanual system operation, costs, and benefits.\nThe example alternative to be evaluated is a proposed\n130-acre center pivot sprinkler irrigation system to\nsupplement natural precipitation (dryland farming). At\n75 percent irrigation application efficiency, about 12.5\ninches of the 16.7 inches applied plus 10 inches of\ngrowing season precipitation is available for plant use.\nCrop budgets show that the increase in gross return\nwill be $347.10 per acre, rounded to $347. This is\ncalculated from the 130 bushel yield increase at a price\nof $2.67 per bushel.\nIn summary, it can be said that the average annual\nbenefits, excluding the cost and operation of the\nirrigation system and the increased variable produc-\ntion costs of corn, is $347 per acre per year.

The average annual cost per acre to own and\noperate the irrigation system and the increased annual\nproduction costs must be determined so that the\nbenefits and costs can be compared.\nOne of the most difficult tasks in performing a cost\nanalysis is to include all costs. Costs associated with\nany enterprise can be diverse and thereby easily over-\nlooked. For this reason farm decisionmakers should\ntry to follow guidelines such as those in this chapter.\nFarm decisionmakers and economists categorize costs\nas fixed and variable to assist in both long-term and\nshort-term financial decisions. These two categories\ntogether constitute total costs.\nCosts are generally classified as being either owner-\nship costs (fixed costs) or operating costs (variable\ncosts). Ownership costs are those costs incurred even\nif no production takes place. These costs are also\nindependent of changes in yield. Examples of owner-\nship costs are depreciation, insurance, taxes, interest,\nhousing, and some maintenance. These costs must be\npaid each year the equipment is owned, even if the\nequipment sits idle. Actual loan amortization is an\nannual ownership cost consideration, typically shorter\nthan the life of purchased equipment.\nOperating costs, commonly called variable costs, are\nthose costs that occur as production takes place.\nTypical operating costs are seed, fuel, fertilizer, power\nfor irrigation systems, and labor. If production does\nnot take place, operating cost items are not needed.\nThe decision to purchase, rent, or lease irrigation\nequipment is extremely important. Fixed cost, variable\ncosts, and total cost should all receive some attention.\nOnce the purchase has been made, however, the\ndecision to use it in any given year is linked closely to\nvariable costs.\n(1) Ownership (fixed) costs\nThe estimated cost of the proposed 130 acre center\npivot irrigation system is shown in exhibit 11–2.",

This conversion is neces-\nsary so that both the benefits and costs are expressed\nin comparable terms, that is, average annual dollars.\nExhibit 11–3 can help determine the average annual\nownership costs per acre.\nNote: The following information is helpful in using the\nworksheet:\nDate—For future reference, it is helpful to show the\ndate the estimates were made.\nYear of price base—The price base will normally be\nthe current year prices.\nEquipment or irrigation system—Identify the\nequipment or irrigation system represented in the\nanalysis. In this case a center pivot sprinkler irrigation\nsystem.\nLife span—The number of years the equipment or\nirrigation system is expected to be used in an opera-\ntion or business. It may be the age at which time the\nitem is completely worn out, or the period may be\nshorter if the equipment is expected to be sold or\nreplaced while retaining some of its original value. Life\nspan for individual components varies. See table 5–2,\nChapter 5, Selecting an Irrigation Method.\nMaintenance costs usually increase with age and use\nof the equipment. The cost of maintenance may also\nbe used to determine the useful life of equipment.\nWhen annual maintenance cost exceeds the an-\nnual cost of purchasing new equipment, then the\neconomic life has been exceeded. The farm man-\nager may still use it if a major investment cannot\npossibly be afforded at this time, or the manager has\nbecome personally attached to a specific piece of\nequipment; i.e., an old tractor that still functions\nsatisfactorily.\nIf the purchase was made with borrowed funds, the\nowner for cash flow purposes may also want to make an\nanalysis using the years of loan repayment as the year\nlife, even though the equipment may physically last\nlonger. In this example all irrigation equipment has been\nassigned a 15-year life. (A more detailed economic\nevaluation would assign different life expectancies to\neach major system component. A separate analysis\nwould be completed for each component.)\nAcres annual use—The number of acres the equip-\nment will be used annually. In this example, the center\npivot will be used on 130 acres; 30 acres in field cor-\nners will remain dryland.\nInterest rate—Use either (a) actual loan rate if funds\nare borrowed, or (b) a representative, competitive\nmarket rate or opportunity cost if producer provides\nfunds (not borrowed).\nNew cost—The purchase price plus installation cost.\nFor this example the initial cost is $100,000.\nSalvage value—This is usually the salvage value or\nremaining value at the time of replacement. This value\nmay be zero if it is completely worn out and has no\nscrap value or will never be sold. Equipment that is\nexpected to be replaced after a given period of time\nand with some remaining operational use should be\nassigned a trade-in value. The system in this example\nis expected to have a remaining value of $5,000, 15\nyears hence.\nThe annual value or cost of the salvage value will be\nthe present value times an interest rate represented by\nthe opportunity cost or the cost of borrowed money. If\none’s own money is used to purchase the equipment,\nuse the opportunity cost. This would be the interest\nrate one could get by investing the money in alterna-\ntive investments having similar risk and time frames. If\nfunds are borrowed, use the interest rate being\ncharged for the use of those funds. In this example, 12\npercent has been selected. The $5,000 salvage value is\ndiscounted to present value (see table 11–1 for present\nvalue factors) and then amortized over the 15-year\nperiod. The $5,000 represents the value of the equip-\nment 15 years hence, or at the end of 15 years.\n$5000 x Present value of 1, 15 years hence\n@ 12% (0.18270) = $914\nAmortization—Amortization involves prorating the\ninitial cost, less salvage value of equipment over its\nuseful life, in this case $99,086 over a 15-year period.\nSee table 11–2 for amortization factors. The value of\nequipment decreases each year through wear, deterio-\nration, or obsolescence, and that value should corre-\nspond to the amount of amortization taken each year.\nThe net investment is converted to an average annual\ncost by amortization. Amortization, also called capital\nrecovery, is the extinguishing of a financial obligation\nin equal installments over time.",

How-\never, unlike amortization, interest or opportunity cost\nvaries with the size of the initial obligation without\nconsideration of salvage value. Purchasing irrigation\nequipment ties up capital (money); therefore, it has an\nopportunity cost. This opportunity cost is the interest\ncost. If a farmer purchases a sprinkler irrigation sys-\ntem for a farm and finances through the owner or bank\non a contract, he/she agrees to repay the principal\namount in a certain number of years. In addition to the\nrepayment of the principal, the borrower must also\npay an interest charge each year. Borrowed capitol is\noften repaid in a time period less than the life span of\nequipment and materials purchased. Farm decision-\nmakers can choose to use this shorter time period to\namortize the initial investment, recognizing salvage\nvalue at the end of the amortized period could be\nsubstantial. However, money is still tied up in the\nirrigation equipment, and opportunity cost (interest)\nstill applies.\nTaxes—Some states levee a property tax on equip-\nment or farm machinery. In this example taxes were\nassumed to be $2,000 per year.\nInsurance—This is an annual charge to cover the loss\nof equipment from fire, theft, windstorm, or any liabil-\nity coverage. It is estimated to be $2,000 per year in\nthis example.\nStandby (fixed) charges for electricity—Providing\nelectrical power availability is generally passed on as a\nfixed cost. Standby charges are paid even if the irriga-\ntion system is not used. In this example the standby\ncharge was $24.84 per acre or $3,230 per year. These\ncharges set by the electric utility company are payable\nevery year. In some areas standby charges are called\ndemand charges.\nOwnership cost per year—This is the sum of the\nannual ownership costs of the irrigation system. In this\nexample it is $21,278.\nOwnership cost per acre—This is the total annual\nownership cost prorated over the number of acres the\nsystem is benefiting. In this example the system is\nbenefiting 130 acres, so the annual ownership cost is\n$21,278 divided by 130 acres, or $168 per acre.\nMost of the ownership costs have now been accounted\nfor and determined to be $168 per acre per year. Total\nannual costs consist of ownership (fixed) costs and\noperating (variable) costs. With the total annual costs\nknown, it can be compared to the total annual ben-\nefits. Notice the break even cost is now $168 per acre\ngreater than before the irrigation system was installed.\nThis difference can only be recovered by increased\noutputs (plant yield or biomass) or reduced inputs\n(labor, tillage).",

Using crop budgets, identify and calculate\nannual gross benefits resulting from the\nchange.\n2. Identify and calculate increased costs on an\nannual basis.\n3.

This is especially true in the short\nterm even if additional income does not completely\ncover ownership costs (principle, taxes, insurance,\ninterest). These costs will occur even when the system\nis setting idle. In the long term, other considerations\nmay need to be made. Example 11–8 illustrates why\none would irrigate as long as operating costs are\ncovered. In reality, operating cost per acre will usually\nincrease with increased yield to additional water,\nfertilizer weed control, and harvest costs.\nSummary: Exhibit 11–8 shows that if the additional\nincome will not cover the additional operating cost, it\nis economically feasible to leave the system idle. Once\noperating costs are covered, it is probably best to run\nthe irrigation system and partly or completely recover\nownership costs. Profits will be realized when addi-\ntional income exceeds the sum of ownership and\noperating costs. Being aware of a close profit margin\ncan stimulate farm decisionmakers to look at other\nareas where costs can be reduced; i.e., reduced tillage,\nproper irrigation scheduling, soil management prac-\ntices to capture a greater portion of rainfall during the\ngrowing season. In this example, operating costs were\nkept constant. In reality, the cost of producing addi-\ntional yield can increase, such as using additional seed\nand applying more fertilizer and water. Improved\nwater management can also increase.\nExhibit 11–8 \tBenefit-to-cost analysis\nIncreased \tIncreased \tAdditional \tNet gain \tNotes\nownership \toperating \tyield/income \tor loss\ncost \tcost\n$/ac \t$/ac \tbu/ac \t$/ac \t$/ac\n168 \tNone \t0 \t0 \t–168 \tSystem is idle, lose only the ownership costs.\n168 \t150 \t25 \t7 \t–251 \tOwnership and operating costs not covered, better\noff left as dryland.\n168 \t150 \t50 \t133 \t–185 \tCovered operating costs and some ownership costs.\nProbable better left as dryland.\n168 \t150 \t75 \t200 \t–118 \tCovered operating costs and some ownership cost.\nLose $118/ac.\n168 \t150 \t100 \t267 \t–51 \tCovered operating costs and most ownership costs.\nLose only $51/ac.\n168 \t150 \t119 \t318 \t0 \tBreak even, ownership, and operating costs cov-\nered.\n168 \t150 \t125 \t334 \t+16 \tGain $16/ac.\n168 \t150 \t150 \t400 \t+82 \tGain $82/ac.",

The management ability and\ndesire of the operator are probably the most important\nfactors in determining the feasibility of irrigation.\nGood water management is essential to realize the full\nbenefit of irrigation. Under poor management a farmer\nwill be paying the full cost of irrigation, but realizing\nonly a portion of the benefits. Too often yields are\nreduced with poor water management (improper\namount, timing, or both). A good manager seeks out\nanswers to questions, such as How much water\nshould be applied to realize the greatest profit? Will\nthe greatest profit be realized at the point of maxi-\nmum yield? Will the increase in yield pay more than\nthe expense of irrigation? The following procedure\ncan help answer these questions.\n(a) Marginal cost and marginal\nreturn\nThe previous analysis in this chapter has been con-\ncerned with the feasibility of investment in an irriga-\ntion system. The question analyzed was: Should I\nswitch from a dry cropland system to an irrigation\ncropland system of crop production?\nOnce the question has been analyzed and answered\nand the irrigation system installed, the optimal amount\nof irrigation water to apply needs to be considered.\nThe optimal amount of water to apply is where the\nmarginal cost is equal to the marginal return for apply-\ning an additional 1.0 acre-inch per acre of water.\nIt is easiest to think in terms of increments. Each 1.0\nacre-inch per acre of water applied will produce an\nassociated increment of costs and an associated incre-\nment of dollar return. In the relevant range of produc-\ntion, the incremental cost will increase while the\nincremental return will decrease. Production should\noccur where the two increments are equal.\nOwnership costs of existing systems are unimportant.\nThe per increment cost (marginal cost) and what that\nincrement produces (marginal return) are important.\nIncrements can be per acre-inch of water applied, per\npound of fertilizer applied, or per pesticide applica-\ntion.\nThe marginal cost in this example is the additional\ncost of irrigation incurred when an additional acre-\ninch of water is applied. Marginal return is the addi-\ntional net return resulting from the added acre-inch of\nwater. Profits are maximized when the marginal cost\nis equal to the marginal return. In the example, the\nvariable input, water, should be added in increments\nuntil the cost of adding the last increment (in this case\nan acre-inch of water) is equal to the net return result-\ning from the addition of the increment.\n(b) Water-yield relationships\nRequired in any marginal cost to marginal return\neconomic analysis, and to continue the example analy-\nsis, is the physical output resulting from the various\nincrements (acre-inches of irrigation water) applied.\nTable 11–3 shows a water-yield relationship.",

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nEconomic Evaluations\tChapter 11\n11–17\t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\n(c) Production function\nOnce the yield data (output) are developed for each\nincrement of the variable input (water), a total produc-\ntion curve can be developed. Product yield versus\nwater applied for the example farm is plotted as figure\n11–1. From this production curve we can also develop\nthe relationship between the marginal cost and mar-\nginal return to determine at what level of water appli-\ncation the profits will be maximized (table 11–4).\nThe first example demonstrated the gross decision\nprocess for whether to irrigate. Also important is an\nincremental decision regarding what is the economic\neffect per increment of input. In this case once irriga-\ntion is chosen, a decision must be made on how much\nwater is applied. The information in table 11–4 is\nbased on:\nCorn @ $2.67 per bushel – $150 per acre ÷ 130\nbushel per acre (variable or increased cost per\ntotal increased yield) = $1.15. (From exhibit 11–\n4, $150 per acre is the increased variable cost to\nproduce 130 bushels per acre of corn.) Net\nincome for the 130 bu/ac increase = $2.67 – $1.15.\nMarginal cost - marginal return analysis is an\nanalysis of affects created by adding increments\nof input—in this example, 1 acre-inch per acre of\nwater. It is a separate process, and not a part of\nother cost to benefit analysis.\nFrom table 11–4, we see that each time 1 net inch of\nwater is applied, the cost is increased $6.00. We also\nsee that each inch of water, from 1 through 16, in-\ncreases the net return by $12 to $13. This example as\npresented uses the same increased costs as additional\nwater is applied. In reality, costs increase as yield\nincreases because of additional seed, fertilizer, har-\nvesting, trucking, and storage. Often when water is\npurchased from an irrigation organization, water costs\nincrease as additional water is applied above a basic\nrate. To know what each increment of water\napplied is costing and buying is necessary.\nSummary: Under the conditions set forth in this ex-\nample profits will be maximized at the application rate\nof 16 inches net, or 20 inches gross, irrigation water\napplied. Even if the water and its application were free,\nit would not be rational to apply more than 16 inches.\nOne can also see that if there is a change in the cost of\nwater and its application or in the price of corn, or both,\nthis relationship shifts and thus a change occurs at the\npoint where profits are maximized.\nOne of the dangers of an analysis of this type is that\nassumptions need to be made concerning costs and\nreturns of the enterprise. Anytime a change occurs in\nthe costs or prices, the cost-price relationship changes\nand a new point of profit maximization is established.\nThe procedure, however, should be useful regardless\nof the relationships and assumptions that exist.\nNote: Marginal cost - marginal return analysis does\nnot apply when growing crops where quality of the\nproduct is more important than yield. Providing ad-\nequate irrigation water at critical growth periods is\nparamount for desirable product quality, such as for\nfresh vegetables, potatoes, melons, berries, fruits, and\nsweet corn. Reduced or even increased water applica-\ntion without knowing what the result is can mean\npotential total crop failure; i.e., unable to produce and\nsell an acceptable quality product. Other local needs,\nsuch as frost protection, temperature control, chemi-\ngation, and seed germination, may require additional\nwater over that necessary for desirable crop produc-\ntion. For annual crops, such as truck crops, a marginal\ncost - marginal return analysis can be done, but by\nusing planted acreage as the variable where the prod-\nuct yield is held constant. With most truck crops,\nadequate soil moisture for the full growing season\nmust be available to obtain desirable yield and product\nquality. Good water management is where applied\nwater can serve two purposes—crop cooling and crop\nwater needs. However, this may not always be the\ncase. For example, frost protection typically occurs\nwhen winter carryover soil moisture is high and crop\nevapotranspiration has not started yet.\nFigure 11–1 \tProduct yield vs. water applied—irrigated\ncorn\n210\n180\n150\n120\n90\n60\n30\n0\nYield per acre (bu)\n0 \t2 \t4 \t6 \t8 \t10 \t12 \t14 \t16 \t18 \t20\nAcre-inches/acre of supplemental\nirrigation water applied (net)",

However, annual cost\nfor 10-inch diameter is not much higher. If energy\ncosts escalate higher than estimated, 10-inch diameter\nwould have been the best choice. Because of the cost\nvariability in PVC pipe, it may be worthwhile to evalu-\nate other class pipe; i.e., class 100 or 85 (with neces-\nsary pressure control devices). Where competitive\npriced energy fuels are available, it may also be worth-\nwhile to compare pumping plants using different\nenergy sources. Typically, the most economical pipe\nsize has velocities in the range of 4 to 6 feet per sec-\nond. Other costs, such as sales tax for purchasing pipe\nmaterials and annual maintenance for pipeline, can be\nincluded at option of the consultant. This analysis can\nbe used to compare benefits of converting from a high\npressure system to a low pressure system. The only\nitem that needs changing is the column, Operating\nhead requirement, in the pipeline hydraulics analysis\ntabular information in solution 1 of the example.\nA simple economic analysis for calculating annual\nenergy savings with a pressure reduction can also be\nused. When everything remains constant except\nchanging the operating pressure, the following equa-\ntion can be used.

Some\nirrigators consider converting from medium to high\npressure sprinkler back to surface irrigation systems\nto reduce or eliminate energy costs. Generally, this\nleads to a considerable reduction in water application\nuniformity with increased runoff, deep percolation, or\nboth. Typically more water must be applied with\ngraded surface irrigation systems than for sprinkler\nirrigation systems, and where the water is pumped\nfrom wells, an energy reduction by converting may not\nbe realized.\nTo maintain an efficient operating pumping plant,\nmodifications to the pump are generally necessary to\nreduce pressure head and increase flow. Many irriga-\ntors who use center pivot or linear move sprinkles are\nconverting to low pressure application devices on\ntheir systems to reduce energy costs. Flow being\npumped to the system remains the same, but pressure\nhead is reduced. This may also require a modification\nto the pump. Reducing pressure by installing a valve\nbetween the pump and sprinkler heads does not re-\nduce energy.\nBecause energy is an immediate cost, the irrigator is\noften more interested in reducing readily apparent\nenergy costs than solving other important problems,\nsuch as poor water management for the full irrigation\nseason or high seepage losses in the on-farm distribu-\ntion system. Table 12–1 demonstrates typical seasonal\nwater use and losses of sprinkler irrigation systems\nversus surface irrigation systems.\nProperly designed and operated surface irrigation\nsystems can provide good irrigation efficiencies. For\nexample, adequately designed, operated, and well-\nmanaged level basin irrigation systems can have\nirrigation efficiencies of 85 to 90 percent. To maintain\na high total farm water use efficiency using level\nbasins, laser controlled field leveling, lined head\nditches with good water control structures, adequate\nflow rate, and proper water and system management\nshould be available and used. Propperly designed,\noperated, and properly managed Low Energy Preci-\nsion Application (LEPA) systems, can reach irrigation\nefficiencies of 90 to 95 percent. To obtain this effi-\nciency with LEPA systems, adequate water manage-\nment and cultural practices should be used to provide\ncomplete water infiltration where the system is used;\ni.e., no water translocation.\nAlthough energy conservation is not a specific NRCS\nobjective, it is a national objective assigned to other\nwater conservation activities that are NRCS objec-\ntives. Finding ways to reduce energy consumption in\nconjunction with soil and water conservation mea-\nsures can be a major selling point when recommend-\ning conservation measures.\nMany irrigation pumping installations were designed\nand installed when energy costs were lower. Typically,\nthe original installation was not as efficient as those\ninstalled today. Some installations were poorly de-\nsigned or improperly installed in the first place. Many\npumping plants have not been maintained properly\nand have significantly lower efficiencies than when\noriginally installed. Length of irrigation sets, and thus\npumping times, is frequently governed more by the\nirrigators schedule than by the needs of the crop. This\nleads to many pumping plant installations being much\nless efficient because of management than they could\nbe.\nTable 12–1 \tSprinkler irrigation system vs. surface\nirrigation system water use and losses\nModerate \tSurface\npressure \tirrigation\nsprinkler irrig. \tsystem\nsystem\n(ac-in/ac) \t(ac-in/ac)\nCrop water requirement \t20 \t20\nMisc. spray losses @ 15% \t4 \t0\nDitch seepage losses @ 15% \t0 \t5.9\nSurface system- DP & RO losses \t0 \t13.4\n@ 40%\nSprinkler system- DP losses @ 10% \t2.7 \t0\nTotal \t26.7 \t39.3",

The\nirrigation decisionmaker is the most important mem-\nber of the team. Pump and equipment dealers and\nmanufacturers should be involved. Electric power\ncompanies and public utility districts are interested in\nelectrical energy conservation. Electrical power con-\nserved is new power not generated. The Extension\nService has an energy conservation objective. Their\nteam members have considerable specialized informa-\ntion and expertise that should be used to the fullest.\nNRCS needs to work closely with other members of\nthe team using the planning process to provide good\nenergy conservation alternatives.\nSeveral manufacturers are named in the information in\nthis chapter. NRCS endorsement is not implied. Names\nare used for illustration only.\n652.1201 \tReducing pump\nenergy requirements\nThe major considerations for ways to reduce pumping\nenergy are:\n• Increase pumping plant efficiency\n• Increase irrigation efficiency\n• Proper irrigation scheduling (amount and\ntiming)\n• Reduce pressure (energy) requirements\n• Conversion from pump to gravity\n• Changing to another irrigation method or\nsystem\n(a) Increase pumping plant\nefficiency\nPumping plant efficiency is the ratio of the amount of\nwork done (output) by a pumping plant (pump and\npower unit) to the amount of energy required to do the\nwork (input). A procedure to check pumping plants is\nincluded in Chapter 15, Planning and Evaluation Tools.\nPumps and many engines and motors are designed to\noperate under a narrow range of conditions. They\nshould be operated within this range for best effi-\nciency. Pumps and power units are subject to wear, so\nclose attention to maintenance is required to sustain\ndesirable pumping efficiency.\nHigh efficient electric motors are designed to operate\nunder a wide range of conditions (half to full load)\nwith less than 1 percent spread in nominal efficiency.\nTypical nominal efficiency range is 94.5 to 95.0 per-\ncent under half to full load of a 3,600 rpm, 50 hp, high\nefficient electric motor. (See table 12–8.) Most manu-\nfactures are more than willing to provide performance\ninformation on their engines and motors.",

Distribution across the field\nshould be uniform. Conveyance losses can be mini-\nmized by installing a ditch lining or pipelines. Leaks of\nany kind should be promptly repaired. The delivery\nsystem should be properly maintained to operate\naccording to original design. The water user should\nstrive for application efficiencies in excess of 80\npercent with all irrigation methods. Chapters 5, 9, and\n15 provide details on irrigation system evaluations.\n(c) Proper irrigation scheduling\n(amount and timing)\nProper irrigation scheduling is applying water at the\nright time and in the amount to meet water needs.\nNeeds can be for crop water needs or other uses, such\nas improved crop quality, crop heating or cooling,\nsalinity management, or chemigation. Where the water\nsupply is not limited, the greatest waste of water (and\nenergy) is usually over irrigation. Excess water appli-\ncation reduces plant yield or biomass, limits the ability\nof soil to grow crops, wastes nutrients, and increases\nthe potential for surface or ground water pollution.\nIn some areas, irrigation water managers are using up\nto 5 times as much water as locally published crop ET\namounts indicate is adequate. Even a simple program\nof irrigation scheduling can greatly reduce this exces-\nsive use. Chapter 9, Irrigation Water Management,\nprovides details on irrigation scheduling methods.\n(d) Reduce pressure (energy)\nrequirements\nLow pressure sprinkler or spray heads are being used\non most new center pivot installations. This saves\nenergy. Some older systems are being retro-fitted to\nuse low pressure heads. Conversion should be done\nwith careful design to maintain overall efficiency. In\nmany cases the pump must be modified or replaced to\nassure optimum energy use; i.e., trim the impellers to\nreduce pressure head. If the water source is a deep\nwell, reducing pressure at the sprinkler nozzle may\nreduce total energy requirements very little. Too often\npressure (and perhaps irrigation equipment) is\nchanged without an associated change in manage-\nment. This results in an even lower irrigation applica-\ntion efficiency. For example, installing LEPA sprinkler\nnozzles without making appropriate changes in soil,\nwater, and plant management often reduces applica-\ntion uniformity. Energy requirements typically stay the\nsame if a valve is used to reduce operating pressures\non the sprinkler system. The pressure upstream of the\nvalve is the same as before; therefore, total pressure\nhead is the same.\nModifying pipe size, changing from high friction loss\npipe to low friction loss pipe, changing field configura-\ntion, and using valves and fittings that reduce friction\nloss can reduce total pressure head requirements. This\ncost can be weighed against the savings in energy,\nrecognizing that energy costs will most likely increase\nin future years.\n(e) Conversion from pump to\ngravity\nMany opportunities occur to wholly, or in part, convert\nfrom pump to gravity supplied pressure for sprinkler\nsystems. Ditches generally must be replaced with\npipelines; therefore, this is costly. However, long-term\nsavings with energy used for pumping can be substan-\ntial. Each foot of elevation provides 0.433 pounds per\nsquare inch of pressure (or 1 lb/in 2 = 2.31 ft of head).\nIn computing available head, pipeline friction loss\nmust be subtracted from the elevation head. An addi-\ntional benefit may be from the reduction of ditch\nseepage losses, improved water control, reduced\nlabor, etc.\n(f) Changing to another\nirrigation method or system\nChanging the present irrigation method or system to\nanother method or system can increase energy effi-\nciency. An example is changing from a handmove\nsprinkler system to an automated furrow or border\nsystem. With proper site conditions, design, and man-\nagement, surface systems can equal or exceed sprin-\nkler system efficiencies. Detailed design and economic\nanalysis generally are required to compare irrigation\nmethods and systems.",

Occa-\nsionally liquid propane or gasoline engines are used.\nMost of the following information deals with electric\nand diesel powered units. If adequate electric power\nsources are located at or within a reasonable distance\nfrom the water source, electric power generally is the\nleast costly form of energy. However, in rural areas\nwhere electrical power is generated from local coal\nfired, fuel oil or natural gas generators, natural gas\nengines are typically less costly to operate. In South-\nern States, natural gas is readily available in most rural\nareas.\nElectric phase converters are available that allow\nthree-phase motors over 10 horsepower to operate on\nsingle-phase power supply. However, they are costly\nto install and require some power to operate. The\ncompany furnishing electric power should be con-\nsulted before installation. Annual hours of use; i.e.,\nirrigating only part season or when supplementing\nprecipitation, need to be considered.\n(a) Energy use criteria\nPerformance standards for an irrigation pumping plant\ncan be expressed as performance standards or water\nhorsepower-hours (wHp-hr) per unit of energy. These\nstandards can be used to compare the cost of energy,\nas used in an efficient irrigation pumping plant, by\ndifferent energy sources. Dollars per wHp-hr can also\nbe used. With both, the energy cost for pumping an\nequal amount of water can be compared for various\nenergy sources. For instance between a natural gas\nand an electric powered pump, if electric power is\navailable.\nOther nonenergy performance units include acre\ninches of water per unit of crop produced (water use\nefficiency), i.e., ac-in/ton of hay. Pumping cost per unit\nof crop produced, i.e., $/bale of cotton, and cost per\nwater horsepower, i.e., $/wHp-hr, can also be used.\n(b) Nebraska pumping plant\nperformance criteria\nPersonnel at the University of Nebraska developed a\nset of performance standards for pumping plants\n(table 12–2). Comparison to the Nebraska criteria\nindicates how well the pumping plant is performing\nand can determine if excess energy is being used.\nDepending on the amount of energy used, a decision\ncan be made regarding adjustments, repairs or\nreplacement.\nNebraska pumping plant performance criteria repre-\nsents the performance level that can be expected from\na properly designed and maintained pumping system.\nIt is a compromise between the most efficient pump-\ning plant possible and the average pumping plant.\nTherefore, some pumping plants will exceed the\ncriteria.\nNebraska criteria are expressed as the water horse-\npower (wHp) produced from a unit of fuel for 1 hour\nand can be represented in the units wHp–hr/unit of\nfuel. The performance of any pumping plant is repre-\nsented by the same units. Performance is calculated by\ndividing the water horsepower produced by the fuel\nconsumption of the pumping plant.\nWater horsepower is a function of water volume\noutput, pressure, lift or suction and pipe friction\nlosses. It is the true work being accomplished by the\npump. (More detail on horsepower calculations is\ncontained in NEH, Part 623 (Section 15), Chapter 8,\nIrrigation Pumping Plants. Water horsepower, which\ndoes not include pumping plant efficiency, can be\ncalculated by:\nwhp = ( \t) × ( \t)\tflow, in gpm \tTDS, in ft\n3 960\t,\nwhere:\nTDH (total dynamic head, in ft) = (lift, in ft) + (pipe\nfriction loss, in ft) + (pressure head, in ft) +\n(velocity head, in ft)",

This is accom-\nplished by dividing the performance of the pumping\nplant by the performance criteria. For example, a\ndiesel producing 75 wHp and burning 6 gallons per\nhour would have a performance of 12.5 wHp–h/gal\n(75 wHp/6 gal/hr).\nComparing this to the diesel criteria of 12.5 wHp-h/gal\nresults in a rating of 100 percent:\n12 5\n12 5 1 0 \t100\n. \t–\n. . \t%\nwhp \thr/gal from pumping plant\nwhp – hr/gal from criteria or\n( \t)\n( \t) =\nThis pumping plant has met the criteria.

In this case the pumping plant would be per-\nforming below the criteria, using unnecessary fuel\n(2 gal/hr).\n(1) Criteria versus overall efficiency\nThe performance rating should not be confused with\nthe pumping plant’s overall efficiency. They are not\nthe same. Overall efficiency is the ratio of the energy\noutput of the pump (water horsepower) compared to\nthe energy used; whereas, the performance rating is\nthe ratio of the performance level of a pump compared\nto the standard performance criteria. The performance\nrating from the criteria does, however, relate to overall\nefficiency of the pump. For diesels, a pumping plant\nwith a performance rating of 100 percent equates to an\noverall efficiency of 23 percent (table 12–3). The above\ndiesel pumping plant had a performance rating of 75\npercent, however, it is not 75 percent efficient. Rather,\nif one wishes to base the performance on overall\nefficiency, the pumping plant would be considered 17\npercent efficient (0.75 x 23% = 17%).\nTable 12–3 \tNebraska performance criteria vs. overall\nefficiency 1/\nEnergy \tUnit of \twHp-h per Perform- \tOverall\ntype \tenergy \tunit of \tance rating \tefficiency\nenergy \t(%) \t(%)\nDiesel \tgal \t12.5 \t100 \t23\nPropane \tgal \t6.89 \t100 \t18\nNatural Gas \tmcf \t61.7 \t100 \t17\nElectric \tkWh \t0.885 \t100 \t66 2/\nGasoline \tgal \t8.66 \t100 \t17\n1/ Efficiency given for electricity is wire to water efficiency, which\nis calculated at the pump site.

The performance rating can be used to rate\nthe pumping plant on a scale of 1 to 100 with 100\nmeaning the criteria have been met. For those pump-\ning plants that exceed the criteria, the index goes\nbeyond 100.\n(2) Using criteria to determine excess fuel\nconsumption\nPerformance criteria are also useful for determining\nexcess fuel consumption of a pumping plant. The\noperational pump performance rating is simply sub-\ntracted from 100, divided by 100, and multiplied by the\npresent fuel consumption. The result is the fuel being\nused in excess of what the criteria recommend. For\nexample, the diesel pumping plant illustrated earlier\nhad a performance rating of 75 percent and was con-\nsuming 8 gallons of fuel per hour. The excess fuel\nconsumption per hour would be 2 gallons per hour.\n(100 - 75/100) x (8 gal/hr) = 2 gal/hr excess\nTable 12–4 \tComparative fuel use\nPerformance \tMultiplier for fuel use\nrating \tin excess of criteria\n(%)\n100 \t1.0\n90 \t1.11\n80 \t1.25\n70 \t1.43\n60 \t1.67\n50 \t2.0\n40 \t2.5\n30 \t3.33\n20 \t5.0\n10 \t10.0\nTable 12–4 shows comparative fuel use at various\nperformance ratings. The criteria can also be used to\ndetermine what the fuel consumption would be for a\nnew pumping plant designed to meet the criteria.\nWater horsepower of the pumping plant is simply\ndivided by the performance criteria to get the fuel\nconsumption per hour. For example, suppose a new\ndiesel-powered deep well turbine pumping plant is\ndesigned to meet the criteria and pump 1,000 gallons\nper minute from 150 feet with a discharge pressure of\n80 pounds per square inch. The horsepower output\nwould be 85 water horsepower. The calculated fuel\nuse would be (85 wHp divided by 12.5 wHp-h/gal = 6.8\ngal/hr). Fuel consumption can also be calculated for\nother design pressures to compare operating costs\nbetween different irrigation systems, such as high or\nlow pressure center pivot. The criteria can even be\nused to compare the operating costs between different\nenergy sources. Table 12–5 is a direct comparison,\nusing this example for fuel consumption and with\nvarious fuels, of hourly costs for different energy\nsources.\nTable 12–5 \tComparison of energy sources\nFuel costs \tHourly cost\n($) \t($)\nDiesel \t1.00 / gal \t6.80\nDiesel \t1.25 / gal \t8.50\nNatural Gas \t2.70 / mcf \t3.72\nNatural Gas \t3.00 / mcf \t4.13\nNatural Gas \t3.50 / mcf \t4.82\nNatural Gas \t4.00 / mcf \t5.51\nElectric \t.04 / kWh \t3.84 1/\nElectric \t.06 / kWh \t5.76 1/\nElectric \t.08 / kWh \t7.68 1/\n1/ Monthly demand charges may be in addition to direct electrical\nenergy use and will vary widely depending on electrical com-\npany.",

Handy information bulletins to determine\nenergy use, methods to reduce energy use from pump-\ning plants, selection of pumps, and pump performance\nare readily available from pump manufacturers and\nmany university Cooperative Extension Services.\nPump and power unit should be carefully matched to\nthe irrigation system flow requirements and Total\nDynamic Head (TDH). Both characteristics should be\naccurately determined. This may involve measuring\nflows in an existing system. A detailed description of\npump characteristics and hydraulic calculation proce-\ndures are contained in NEH Section 15, Chapter 8,\nIrrigation Pumping Plants.\nkW\nhp kW\n= ( \t) × ( \t) × ( \t) × ( )\n( \t)\n=\n3 6\n0 746\n. \t*\n.\nmeter disc revolutions \tmeter constant, Wh\ntime, in seconds\nwhere:\nkW = kilowatts used by the electric motor\nWh = watthour meter constant, used to convert to kilowatt hours used\nhp = horsepower\n* \t= Where installations use a high rate of electrical energy, the electric company will install meters that only\nput a small part of the energy used through the meter.

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nEnergy Use and Conservation\tChapter 12\n12–12 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nAlmost all pumps have moving parts that require some\ntype of lubrication to prevent wear. In some instances\nthe bearings are lubricated and sealed a the time of\nmanufacture. In others oil or grease must be added\nperiodically or continuously, and even water itself may\nbe used as the lubricant. Where water is pumped from\nwells using oil lubricated shafts, a layer of oil several\ninches thick often accumulates on the water surface.\nSediment in irrigation water causes wear of any pump.\nPropeller and centrifugal pumps handle a reasonable\namount of sediment, but require periodic replacement\nof impellers and volute cases. Turbine pumps are more\nsusceptible to damage because of the sediment in the\nwater. Deep well turbine pumps can be costly to\ninspect for excessive wear. Positive displacement\npumps must be used only with sediment-free liquids.\nFertilizer and chemical injection pumps are typically\npositive displacement pumps and can provide the\nrequired accurate control of injected chemicals.\n(a) Pump characteristic curves\nPump characteristic curves, sometimes called pump\nperformance curves or head capacity curves, display\nthe relationship between head (pressure) produced\nand the water volume pumped. Because of their me-\nchanical nature, pumps have certain well defined\noperating properties. Pump characteristic or perfor-\nmance curves are available and essential for determin-\ning pumping plant requirements.\nData for these curves are developed by testing a num-\nber of pumps of a specific model. A set of curves or\ntables is prepared that represents the specific operat-\ning condition for each impeller and pump model. Field\noffices rarely have copies of all possible pump curves\nfor all pumps used in their area. Generally, though, the\nmajority of pumps in an area are of few makes, types,\nand models that are handled by local dealers. An effort\nshould be made to obtain pump curves for these\npumps from suppliers or from the manufacturer.\nTypically, they are readily available.\nPerformance of pumps changes with time. Since they\nare mechanical devices, they wear, and the rate of\nwear is dependent on the amount and kind of sedi-\nment pumped. Replacement of the impeller, wear\nrings, or even the entire bowl assembly may be re-\nquired when wear has become excessive. The best\nway to evaluate an installed pump’s performance is to\ndo a field pump test described in Chapter 9, Irrigation\nWater Management. The field test should provide\ninformation needed for decisions on pump repair or\nenergy reduction.\nPerformance curves are typically available for every\nmake, model, and size pump commercially manufac-\ntured. However, it may be difficult to obtain perfor-\nmance curves for older pumps and for pumps where\nthe impellers are used in the same pump, a perfor-\nmance curve is prepared for each size impeller. With\nmultiple impellers (i.e., deep well turbine pumps),\nhead developed by each impeller (stage) is accumu-\nlated. Speed of rotation also affects impeller perfor-\nmance.\nA prerequisite to selecting the right pump or analyzing\nan existing pump is knowing how to read pump char-\nacteristic curves. Each manufacturer’s curve looks a\nlittle different, and each type of pump has a slightly\ndifferent set of curves. Most common characteristic\ncurves provided by manufacturers and typically in-\ncluded on most pump performance curves are:\n• Total dynamic head (ft) versus discharge (gpm)\n• Efficiency (%) versus discharge (gpm)\n• Input power (bhp) versus discharge (gpm)\n• Net positive suction head (ft) versus discharge\n(gpm)\nNormally, the NRCS technician only provides a head/\ncapacity requirement, i.e., 900 gpm at 150 foot head,\nfor dealer and owner pump selection. More detailed\ninformation is provided for better understanding, and\nto allow specific pump evaluation.\nThe following section illustrates how to read typical\npump performance curves for each major type pumps\nused to pump irrigation water.",

This type pump is driven by a\n1,760 rpm electric motor. Four factors, all related to\ndischarge capacity in gallons per minute, are shown on\nthe chart. They are:\n• total dynamic head\n• pump efficiency\n• brake horsepower\n• net positive suction head\nThe first three curves display the effect of different\nimpeller diameters. For example, if a pump was re-\nquired to deliver 900 gpm at 150 feet of TDH, read the\nchart as follows:\nEnter the left side with TDH of 150 feet and the bot-\ntom at 900 gallons per minute. The intersection of\nthese two is just above the 12 3/4-inch diameter impel-\nler curve. Therefore, the next larger impeller must be\nused, which is 13 1/4-inch diameter. At a TDH of 150\nfeet, this pump puts out about 1,040 gallons per\nminute. If pump discharge is limited with a valve to\n900 gallons per minute, TDH raises to 170 feet of head,\nand efficiency is read at 900 gallons per minute on the\nefficiency curve as about 78 percent (read left effi-\nciency scale). If pump discharge is not limited with a\nvalve, efficiency for 1,040 gallons per minute is read as\n77 percent. Brake horsepower is about 50. Maximum\nallowable net positive suction head (NPSH) is about 6\nfeet. (Suction head exceeding this causes operation\nproblems and loss of efficiency.) If the increased TDH\nis unacceptable, exact head/discharge can be obtained\nby trimming the impeller diameter. Energy used will\nreduce accordingly.\nFigure 12–5 \tSingle speed centrifugal pump (courtesy of Berkeley Pump Company)\n13 1/2\" full diameter\n13 1/4\" dia. 50 hp\n12 3/8\" dia. 40 hp\n11 3/8\" dia. 30 hp\n10 3/4\" dia. 25 hp\n10 1/16\" dia. 20 hp\nHead\n\tNPSHR\n60%\n65%\n\t70%\n\t75%\n80%\n75%\n70%\n65%\nEfficiency\n60%\n60 bhp\n50 bhp\n40 bhp\n30 bhp\n25 bhp\n20 bhp\n15 bhp\n0 \t200 \t400 \t600 \t800 \t1000 \t1200 \t1400\n30\n20\n10\n0\nNPSHR (feet)\nCapacity (U.S. gallons per minute)\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nTotal dynamic head (feet)\n125\n150\n175\n200\nCase: Material C.I.

Recalculation of friction losses\nis necessary. An Irrigation System Performance Curve\n(friction loss vs. capacity) can be plotted or overlaid\nonto the pump characteristic curve. The pumping\nplant operates where the two curves cross (intersect).\nPumps shown in the curve are for standard 30-, 40-,\nand 50-horsepower sizes. If the brake horsepower\nrequire is slightly over a standard size motor, consult\nthe motor manufacturer to see if overload is accept-\nable. Otherwise, use the next larger motor.\nA flow of 1,040 gallons per minute is not the design\nflow of 900 gallons per minute. You must now decide\nto accept this or look at the alternatives. The alterna-\ntives are:\n• Use the next size smaller pump and accept\nlower flow.\n• Look for another brand or model pump that\nbetter fits the conditions.\n• Reduce TDH to about 137 feet by increasing\npipe sizes or reducing output pressure, then go\nto the smaller 40-horsepower pump.\n• Increase the TDH by closing a valve slightly\nuntil a discharge of 900 gallons per minute is\nreached. This action is not energy efficient;\nhowever, it can be most practical where dis-\ncharge is to be limited.\nPump selection is always a select, recalculate, and re-\ntry compromise to find the most efficient pump that\nbest fits the desired conditions.\n(2) Multispeed centrifugal pumps\nFigure 12–6 illustrates a set of curves for a single\nimpeller size multispeed centrifugal pump. Multispeed\npumps are generally driven by an internal combustion\nengines. Curves shown are head, brake horsepower,\nand pump efficiency versus capacity curves.\nDesign head/discharge should be located to the right\nof peak pump efficiency. As wear occurs, pump effi-\nciency increases giving a higher life span efficiency\nthan if designed for absolute peak efficiency initially.\nFor example, if a pump is to deliver 1,100 gallons per\nminute at 60 feet TDH, find the rotations per minute\nand horsepower required.\nEnter the left side with TDH of 60 feet and the bottom\nwith 1,100 gpm. Read required shaft speed of pump as\nslightly above 1,800 rpm, bhp as about 21 horsepower,\nand efficiency as about 80 percent. Note that this\nperformance is based on a suction lift of 15 feet. Less\nsuction lift should be used at higher elevation to\nmaintain performance. Table 12–6 displays practical\nstatic suction lift.\nTotal suction lift equals static lift plus friction loss in\nsuction pipe, elbows, and foot valve plus velocity\nhead. The example is for 900 gallons per minute with\n6-inch diameter welded steel suction pipe, elbow, foot\nvalve; a 5,000-foot elevation, and maximum water\ntemperature of 80 °F.\nGiven:\nStatic lift (water surface to eye of pump inlet) = 15.4 ft\nFriction loss (calculated) \t= \t5.2 ft\nVelocity head (calculated) \t= \t.6 ft\nTotal \t= 22.18 ft\nTable 12–6 \tPractical static suction lift\nElevation \tMaximum \t- - - - Practical static suction lift 2/ - - - -\ntheoretical \tat various water temperatures\nsuction lift 1/ \t60 °F \t70 °F \t80 °F \t90 °F\n(ft) \t(ft) \t(ft) \t(ft) \t(ft) \t(ft)\nSea level \t34.0 \t23.4 \t23.2 \t23.0 \t22.6\n500 \t33.4 \t23.0 \t22.8 \t22.5 \t22.2\n1,000 \t32.7 \t22.4 \t22.4 \t22.0 \t21.8\n1,500 \t32.1 \t22.0 \t21.9 \t21.6 \t21.4\n2,000 \t31.5 \t21.6 \t21.5 \t21.2 \t20.9\n3,000 \t30.3 \t20.8 \t20.6 \t20.4 \t20.1\n4,000 \t29.2 \t20.0 \t19.9 \t19.6 \t19.3\n5,000 \t28.1 \t19.2 \t19.1 \t18.8 \t18.6\n6,000 \t27.0 \t18.5 \t18.3 \t18.1 \t17.8\n1/ Maximum theoretical lift of water at 50 °F and lower.\n2/ 70 percent of theoretical maximum.",

For gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and propane\npowered engines, all hose connections should be tight\nwith zero leaks.\nFor centrifugal pumps, installations should provide:\n• Concrete slab foundation for a solid support of\nmotor and pump and allow proper alignment of\ndrive shaft. Do not secure pump and motor to\nthe foundation. Allow the unit to seek its own\nposition.\n• Supports for suction and discharge pipes close\nto the pump.\n• Adequate size pipe and fittings to prevent\ncavitation and minimize friction losses.\nFor vertical turbine pumps, installations should provide:\n• Concrete slab foundation around the well head\nand pump base to provide support for gear\nhead, engine, or motor and allow proper align-\nment of pump drive shaft.\n• Maintain proper lubricant levels in gear head\nand pump shaft.\n• Provide for adequate pump impeller submer-\ngence.\n• Adequate size discharge pipe in the well.\n• Adequate well capacity\nFor submersible pumps, installations should provide:\n• Corrosion resistant cable support for pump\nmotor, electric cable, and pipeline.\n• Adequate size discharge pipe in the well.\n• Adequate pump impeller submergence.\n• Adequate well capacity.\n• Proper size electric wire or cable from motor to\ncontrol box.\nSafety control devices should be considered standard\ninstallation items. Lightning protection devices are\nconsidered and installed according to manufacturer’s\nrecommendations. Pressure control switches should\nbe provided to allow pumping plant shut-off should\nsudden pressure drop at downstream side of pump\noccur. Typical examples are a break in a pipeline or a\ncontrol valve failure. Water level control sensors in\npump sumps can provide pump shut-off should the\nwater source be interrupted. This device prevents\npumps from operating with no water. Electric surge\nprotectors should be considered to help protect elec-\ntric panels and motors from lightening\n(c) Electric motors\nElectric motors should be carefully matched between\nload and electrical supply conditions. To do otherwise\nresults in wasted power and higher than required\ninitial installation and maintenance costs.\nTable 12–7 lists standard electric motor sizes and\nspeeds available, and electric current phase used to\noperate 10 horsepower or larger three-phase motors\nwith single-phase current.\nTable 12–7 \tElectric current phase required for standard\nelectric motor sizes 1/\nMotor \t3,600 \t1,800 \t1,200 \t900 \t720 \t600\nhp \trpm \trpm \trpm \trpm \trpm \trpm\n1 \t1,3 \t1,3 \t1,3\n1.5 \t1,3 \t1,3 \t1,3\n2 \t1,3 \t1,3 \t1,3\n3 \t1,3 \t1,3 \t1,3\n5 \t1,3 \t1,3 \t1,3 \t1,3\n7.5 \t1,3 \t1,3 \t1,3 \t3\n10 \t1,3 \t1,3 \t3 \t3\n15 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3\n20 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3\n25 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3\n30 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3\n40 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3\n50 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3\n60 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3\n75 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3\n100 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3\n125 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3\n150 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3 \t3\n200 \t3 \t3\n250 \t3 \t3\n300 \t3 \t3\n1/ 1 = single-phase electric current, 1φ\n3 = three-phase electric current, 3φ.",

In most areas, a 10-\nhorsepower motor is the maximu size that can be\npowered directly with single-phase current. Local\nutility companies may further limit the maximum size\nto 7.5 horsepower.\n(2) Phase converters\nSingle-phase motors can be used to operate larger\nhorsepower motors if a phase converter is used. Two\nmost common types of converters are an auto trans-\nformer-capacitor converter (for horsepower to 100)\nand a rotary converter (for up to 200 horsepower\nmotors or groups of motors). Converters are expen-\nsive, and a 2 percent or greater energy loss occurs\nwhen using them.\nRural electric power companies generally limit con-\nverter size because of the limited power line capacity\nthe amount of current required during startup. Electric\nmotors require three to five times running amperage\nfor startup. Maximum motor size may be limited to 15\nhorsepower in some cases. A check with the local\nelectrical company will address these concerns.\n(3) Three-phase electric motors\nElectric motors are rated according to their brake\nhorsepower. Typically, this is the horsepower output\nthat can be continuously delivered, as rated by the\nmanufacturer. Electric motors can develop more\nhorsepower than shown on the nameplate; however,\nloading above the nameplate horsepower can cause\nexcess motor heating. Heat reduces motor life because\nheat accelerates the breakdown of motor insulation\nand other components. Three-phase motors do not\nrequire a starting mechanism; thus, they have fewer\nmoving parts than do single-phase motors.\nSome motors have a service factor (SF). Most three-\nphase motors used for irrigation have a service factor\nof 1.15. The service factor allows short-term loading\nabove the brake horsepower rating without seriously\naffecting motor life, as long as good heat dissipation is\nmaintained. Generally, service factor loading should\nnot be used for continuous power. It is intended to be\na safety factor.\nAn electric motor is not 100 percent efficient. Some\nenergy is lost in converting electrical energy into\nmechanical energy. Electric motor efficiency is typi-\ncally 80 to 95 percent. Larger motors are more efficient\nthan smaller motors. Also a small motor’s efficiency is\nhighest at 3/4 load. Table 12–8 displays nominal effi-\nciencies for standard and high efficient motors. To\navoid overloading, it may be advantageous to use the\nnext larger electric motor. Operating any electric\nmotor below its rated load capacity decreases the\nelectric to mecahnical energy efficiency.\nTable 12–8 \tNominal efficiencies for standard and high\nefficiency electric motors (courtesy of\nMarathon Electric, Wausau, Wisconsin)\nHorse- \tStandard efficiency motor \tHigh efficiency motor\npower \tnominal efficiency (%) \tnominal efficiency (%)\nfull \t3/4 \t1/2 \tfull \t3/4 \t1/2\nload \tload \tload \tload \tload \tload\n3,600 rpm, 460 volt\n5 \t84.0 \t86.0 \t84.5 \t89.5 \t89.5 \t88.5\n10 \t84.0 \t85.0 \t82.0 \t91.7 \t92.4 \t91.7\n20 \t86.5 \t86.5 \t83.5 \t92.4 \t92.4 \t92.4\n30 \t87.5 \t87.5 \t85.5 \t93.6 \t94.1 \t93.6\n40 \t91.0 \t91.0 \t89.0 \t94.1 \t94.1 \t93.6\n50 \t91.7 \t91.7 \t91.0 \t94.5 \t95.0 \t94.5\n75 \t93.6 \t93.6 \t92.4 \t95.0 \t94.5 \t95.0\n100 \t94.1 \t94.1 \t93.0 \t95.4 \t95.4 \t95.0\n150 \t93.6 \t93.0 \t91.7 \t95.4 \t95.4 \t95.0\n1,800 rpm, 460 volt\n5 \t85.5 \t83.5 \t81.5 \t— \t— \t—\n10 \t87.5 \t88.5 \t87.5 \t— \t— \t—\n20 \t89.5 \t90.2 \t89.0 \t92.4 \t93.0 \t93.0\n30 \t89.5 \t88.5 \t80.5 \t94.1 \t94.1 \t94.1\n40 \t90.2 \t89.5 \t88.0 \t94.5 \t94.5 \t94.5\n50 \t91.0 \t91.0 \t90.2 \t94.5 \t95.0 \t94.5\n75 \t93.0 \t93.0 \t91.7 \t95.4 \t95.8 \t95.8\n100 \t92.4 \t93.0 \t92.4 \t95.8 \t95.8 \t95.8\n150 \t94.1 \t93.6 \t92.4 \t96.2 \t96.2 \t95.8",

The\ndifference between no load and full load speeds for\nthree-phase motors is small. For example: 1,800 rpm at\nno load and 1,760 rpm at full load. Motor speed is con-\ntrolled by cycles per second of alternating current.\n(d) Internal combustion engines\nEngines generally operate more efficiently when used\nat 75 to 100 percent of their continuous rated horse-\npower. The manufacturer’s recommendation for\nloading should be followed. If internal combustion\nengines are to operate efficiently, a good maintenance\nprogram should also be followed.\nThe horsepower rating applicable to a pump engine is\nthe continuous horsepower available at the output\nshaft. It is common practice for engine manufacturers\nto list power ratings without cooling fans (and other\nrequired accessories), which can consume 5 to 8\npercent of engine power. When a radiator cooled\nengine is used, this loss or extra power use must be\ntaken into account. Attachments can be obtained that\ncirculate irrigation water to cool the engine and thus\neliminate fan energy loss. Engine efficiency can be\nchanged as much as 5 percent with some engine\nmodifications.\nAltitude, humidity, and air temperature affect engine\npower output. For naturally aspirated (nonturbo-\ncharged) engines, it is standard industry practice to\nderate engine power output by 3.5 percent for each\n1,000 feet above a 500-foot altitude and 1.0 percent for\neach 10 °F above 85 °F.\n(e) Pump installation\nA flow meter, or other water measuring device, and a\nproperly operating pressure gauge should be installed at\neach pump site to monitor pump operation. This infor-\nmation can be invaluable for determining when pump\nefficiency is starting to drop so that corrective actions\ncan be taken. Typically a 5 percent drop in pressure or\nvolume output is a signal that pump (or well) mainte-\nnance should be considered. A sudden drop in line\npressure could indicate a break in the pipeline or other\nabrupt change in system. A position change of the\ndistribution or application system can also cause a\npressure variation at the pump; i.e., a pivot lateral mov-\ning from a downhill position to an uphill position. A flow\n(rate and volume) meter can be of great value for mak-\ning some water management decisions.\nFoot valves on suction pipelines prevent backflow\nfrom occurring when the pump is shut off. Without a\nfoot valve, the suction pipe is drained each time the\npump is shut off, allowing the pipe to be filled with air.\nWhen air enters the suction side of the pipeline, gener-\nally due to improper installation, flow is restricted. Air\nin the pump can also cause cavitation to accelerate\npump wear. Higher velocities (3 to 5 ft/s) tend to move\nsuspended air through the pipeline. Backflow preven-\ntion valves and air-vacuum release valves located just\ndownstream of pump discharge should also be consid-\nered. They help prevent reverse flows through the\npump and potential collapse of discharge pipelines,\nespecially where pumping uphill. All these devices just\ndiscussed should be considered a part of any pump\ninstallation.\nHow a pump is installed can significantly affect overall\noperating efficiency. Unfortunatly many installations\nare not adequately installed. The following specific\ninformation relates to individual pump types.\n(1) Centrifugal pumps\nCentrifugal pump suction pipeline must be free of air\nleaks and must not have high points that can cause air\naccumulation or restricted flow. Also pump priming is\ndifficult when suction pipline air leaks are excessive.\nFigure 12–9 illustrates pump installation consider-\nations. Figure 12–10 illustrates priming arrangements\nand foot valve needs for centrifugal pumps.",

Rules relating performance\nwith change in speed and for change in diameter apply\nfor all types of centrifugal pumps. Example 12–1\nillustrates these rules.\nA constant diameter impeller:\n• Pump capacity varies directly as speed.\n• Head varies as the square of the speed.\n• Horsepower input varies as the cube of the\nspeed.\nAt constant speed:\n• Capacity varies directly with the impeller\ndiameter.\n• Head varies as the square of the impeller\ndiameter.\n• Horsepower varies as the cube of the impeller\ndiameter.\nRules for impeller diameter are used in a similar way.\nBy computing the performance of the pump at a num-\nber of points along its characteristic curve, a new set\nof curves can be plotted. These curves typically agree\nfairly close with actual pump performance curves and\ncan be sufficient for planning purposes.\nStandard diameter impellers for centrifugal pumps can\nbe trimmed (reducing impeller diameter) to meet a\nspecific head requirement. Impellers are trimmed to\nreduce operating pressure and energy requirements.\nTrimming is more cost effective than replacing the\npump. However, the amount of impeller trim which\noccur and still maintain good pump performance is\nlimited. Manufacturers can provide performance\ncurves for the newly trimmed impeller.\nAlthough horizontal shaft centrifugal pumps are most\ncommon, a vertical shaft, or vertical shaft and sub-\nmerged pump volute can be used. Submerged vertical\nshaft centrifugals operate similar to vertical turbines.\nExample 12–1 \tChange of performance rules\nGiven:\nA pump delivering 500 gpm at 1,150 rpm and 50 ft\nhead requires 10 hp.\nDetermine:\nCapacity, head, and power input of this unit if\nmotor speed is increased to 1,750 rpm.\nSolution:\nNew capacity is in the same ratio as the speeds:\n1 750\n1 150 500 \t760\n,\n, × \t=\tgpm \tgpm\nNew head is in the same ratio of the speeds\nsquared:\n1 750\n1 150 50 \t116\n2\n2\n,\n, × \t=\tft \tft\nNew horsepower is the ratio of the speeds cubed:\n1 750\n1 150 10 \t35\n3\n3\n,\n, × \t=\thp \thp",

These devices allow the rotations\nper minute (rpm), or speed, of the motor to be re-\nduced. Horsepower is also reduced. The drive consists\nof a converter that changes AC power to DC power\nand an inverter that changes DC power into adjustable\nfrequency AC power. As the frequency of the power is\ndecreased, the power to the motor and the motor rpm\nare both reduced. This decrease in motor rpm can\nsubstantially reduce the pump horsepower demand\nsince the pump horsepower demand is proportional to\nthe pump rpm cubed. A small change in rpm then\ncauses a significant change in pump horsepower\ndemand. Figure 12–13 shows that reducing the rpm by\nabout 20 percent reduces horsepower demand by\nabout 50 percent. Reducing the rpm from 1,770 down\nto 1,400, for example, decreases the horsepower\ndemand of a 100-horsepower pump to 50 horsepower.\nThe pump output, capacity, and the total dynamic\nhead, is also determined by the rpm. The capacity is\nproportional to the rpm, while the total head is propor-\ntional to the rpm squared. Figure 12–13 also illustrates\nthese relationships. For example, a 20 percent reduc-\ntion in rpm decreases the pump capacity by 20 percent\nand the total head by nearly 38 percent.\nBecause of these relationships, adjusting the pump\nrpm may not yield the same total dynamic head and\ndischarge capacity obtained under a throttled (partly\nclosed valve downstream of pump) condition. The\nactual total head and capacity at a particular rpm\ndepend on the impeller design, which defines the\nrelationship between total head and pump capacity.\nVariable frequency drives must be protected from\nadverse environmental conditions, including damp-\nness, dust, and extremes in temperature and altitude.\nOne manufacturer recommends installations where\nambient air temperature is maintained between 14 and\n122 degrees Fahrenheit, humidity is maintained below\n90 percent, and the elevation is below 3,300 feet.\nVariable frequency drives can also affect the efficiency\nof the pumping plant. The lower the rpm, the less\nefficient the motor and the variable frequency drive.\nDown to about 50 percent of the maximum rpm, the\ndrive efficiency may decrease only slightly, but at\nlower rpm’s the efficiency of the drive falls dramati-\ncally. Manufacturers can supply characteristic curves\nfor specific diameter and width impellers at reduced\nrpm’s.\nVariable speed drives eliminate energy waste caused\nby a throttled pump by producing a discharge similar\nto that of a throttled pump, but at a lower horsepower.\nThe economic affect of these devices depends on the\ndecrease in horsepower demand, operating time,\nelectric energy costs, and cost (purchase, installation\nand maintenance) of the variable speed drive. The\nbenefit of the variable speed drive is the savings in\nannual electric energy cost, which amounts to the\ndifference in energy costs between the constant rpm\noperation and the reduced speed operation. Perma-\nnent required pressure (energy) is less costly and\npreferred.\nFigure 12–13 \tRatio of pump characteristics to pump rpm\nPump horsepower\nPump total head\nPump capacity\n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nPercent of maximum pump characteristic\n0 \t10 \t20 \t30 \t40 \t50 \t60 \t70 \t80 \t90 100\nPercent of maximum RPM",

Water quality\nmust be evaluated on its suitability for the intended\nuse. Often water (and effluent) use is based on the\ndesires of the decisionmaker and not the crop. Spe-\ncific uses can have different water quality needs. The\nirrigator must know the quality of water used for\nirrigation. If contaminants are present, the type and\nconcentration must be determined.\nIrrigation water used for agriculture can contain\nundesirable contaminants, such as dissolved salts\n(salinity and sodicity), suspended sediment, gypsum,\nnaturally occurring toxic elements, nematodes, and\nwater borne diseases. Tailwater (runoff) from surface\nirrigation systems can be reused as a water supply, but\ncan also contain contaminants, such as sediment,\nagricultural fertilizers, pesticides, and organic mate-\nrial. Discharge from subsurface drainage systems,\ntreated municipal sewage, industrial wastes, agricul-\ntural food processing, and wastes from confined\nlivestock and fish feeding operations can also be used\nto supplement existing supplies.\nDisposal of wastes on cropland as plant nutrients and\nsoil amendments is encouraged by regulatory agen-\ncies. Naturally occurring microbial activity helps break\ndown (metabolize) organic solids and contaminants.\nCaution must be exersized, however, when applying\ntreated municipal sewage and industrial wastes to\ncropland. Depending on treatment level, these sources\ncan contain pathogens, viruses, coliforms, salts, toxic\nmetals, or acids. Geothermal (hot) water can also be\nused for irrigation, but generally must be cooled by\nsprinkling or storage before being applied to crops. It\ncan also contain elements toxic to soils and plants\n(i.e., boron, chloride, sodium, sulfur, and toxic met-\nals). Cold water can retard plant growth for short\nperiods of time.\nGood quality water promotes maximum yield if good\nsoil and water management practices are used. With\nlesser quality water, soil and cropping problems can\nbe expected, unless appropriate management prac-\ntices are adopted. It may be desirable to use low\nquality water for irrigation of specific crops in specific\nareas rather than allow low quality water to discharge\ninto public surface water. However, high quality water\nmay be required for irrigating certain specialty crops\nbecause of required crop quality or soil contaminant\nstandards or to meet interstate transportation and\nmarketing requirements. Nursery potted plants is one\nexample.\nTypically lesser quality water can be used to irrigate\ngrowing crops than is required for germination and\nsprouting. Generally poor quality water should not be\nmixed with high quality water. On the surface, mixing\nhigh quality water with low quality water may seem to\nimprove the low water quality. In reality a poor water\nquality still exists, and using it can allow contaminants\n(i.e., salts) to accumulate in the soil profile throughout\nthe irrigation season. As an example, with proper\nsalinity management, poorer quality water can be used\nto grow many crops during most of the growing sea-\nson. The high quality water is then available for germi-\nnation, sprouting, and leaching of accumulated salts,\nas well as meeting plant water needs for low salt-\ntolerant crops.\nAnnual leaching can be eliminated by growing crops\nless tolerant to toxic elements early in the crop rota-\ntion following leaching. As toxic elements accumulate\n(usually in the soil profile), more salt-tolerant crops\nare grown. Leaching is performed following the last\ncrop in the rotation. Crop rotation examples are:\n• beans, corn, wheat, and barley\n• lettuce, cantaloupe, sorghum, and cotton\n• beans, cauliflower, cucumber, broccoli, and\nsquash\nPhysical contaminants and organic particles can\nadversely affect some irrigation systems. They also\npresent challenges for design of screening devices that\nwill satisfactorily remove contaminates. Physical\ncontaminants include suspended debris, moss, and\nsubmersed aquatic plants. Algae and bacterial slimes\nare organic particles.\nParticulates, including small aquatic organisms, can plug\nnozzles and orifices in sprinkle and micro irrigation\nsystems. Floating trash and debris may cause trouble in\nsystems that discharge water through larger gates or\nopenings. Small aquatic organisms including snails,\nfreshwater clams, and other invertebrates can plug\npump screens if large numbers congregate at the intake.\nDifferent sizes and types of screening and filtration\ndevices are required to prevent these problems.",

Good irrigation\nwater management requires complete control of water\ndelivery.\nWater suitability for irrigation is determined by the\npotential to cause soil, plant, or management prob-\nlems. Appropriate management practices should be\nselected to avoid unacceptable levels of biomass or\nyield reduction. Suitability must be evaluated at the\nfarm level for specific use and potential hazard to\ncrops and personal health. Available farm manage-\nment and the farm situation must be considered.\nRemoving larger sized floating debris by irrigation\norganization facilities (trash racks, rotating screens)\nmay be desirable.\nWater quality is a major consideration when selecting\nirrigation method. Adequate data on water quality is\nessential in the selection process. All irrigation water\ncontains some dissolved solids (salts). Significant\nbuild-up of these salts can occur without proper irriga-\ntion method selection, operation, and management.\nThe leaching capability of the irrigation method is a\nconsideration. It becomes increasingly important as\nsalt content of the irrigation water increases.\n652.1301 \tEffect of water\nquality on irrigation\nsystem, soil, and crops\nSuitability of water for irrigation depends on the total\namount and kind of salts, ions and other toxic ele-\nments in the water. Suitability must also consider\ncrops grown, irrigation water management, cultural\npractices, and climate factors. Guidelines for evaluat-\ning water quality for irrigation are given in table 13–1.\nThese guidelines are limited to water quality param-\neters that are normally encountered and that materi-\nally affect crop production. Laboratory determinations\nand calculations needed to use the guidelines are\ndisplayed in table 13–2.\nAdditional information and details on effects of spe-\ncific ions are provided in the National Engineering\nHandbook (NEH), Part 623, Chapter 2, Irrigation Water\nRequirements. Also see American Society of Civil\nEngineers (ASCE) Report 71, Agricultural Salinity\nAssessment and Management.\n(a) Salinity and sodicity\nSalinity or sodicity relates to water quality if the total\nquantity of salts in the irrigation water is high enough\nthat salts accumulate in the crop root zone or on the\nplant and to the extent that crop growth and yield are\naffected. Where excessive soluble salts accumulate in\nthe root zone, plants have increasing difficulty in\nextracting water from the soil profile. Reduced water\nuptake by the plant can result in slow or reduced\ngrowth. This can cause the appearance of a drought\ncondition (i.e., plant wilting) even with relative high\nsoil moisture conditions. Crops have different salinity\nand sodicity tolerance levels, plus effects of salinity\nand sodicity can vary with growth stage. Tolerance to\nsalinity or sodicity can be very low at germination and\nsmall seedling stage, but usually increases as the plant\ngrows and matures.",

Infiltration rate can decrease to the point that\nsufficient water cannot infiltrate to adequately supply\nthe crop. Sodium causes soil particles to disperse,\nresulting in a massive soil structure with low perme-\nability. Where exchangeable sodium is excessive, soil\npermeability is reduced in low calcium level soils. Low\nsalinity and high pH can also decrease soil permeabil-\nity as much as sodium. Sodium Adsorption Ratio\n(SAR) is most often used to define infiltration and\npermeability problems; however, a combination of\nSAR and EC i may be more indicative of problems. See\nfigure 13–2 for threshold values of a combination of\nSAR and ECi for potential infiltration and permeability\nhazards. Adjusted SAR is used where bicarbonates are\npresent. Often, gypsum (calcium) is added to the soil\nto improve infiltration and permeability.\n(c) Toxicity\nCrop toxicity problems occur when certain elements\nare available in the soil-water solution and taken up by\nthe plants. Toxic elements can accumulate in amounts\nthat result in reduced crop yield or quality. Toxicity\nnormally results when certain ions are absorbed by the\nplant with soil water, move with the plant transpira-\ntion stream, and accumulate in the leaves at concen-\ntrations that cause plant damage. This is usually re-\nlated to one or more specific ions available in irriga-\ntion water, i.e., boron, chloride, and sodium. Not all\ncrops are sensitive to these ions. White deposits on\nleaves or other plant parts may indicate the presence\nof salt. White deposits can occur on fruit or leaves as a\nresult of sprinkler irrigation where water with high\nbicarbonate concentration is used. Toxicity often\naccompanies or complicates a salinity or infiltration\nproblem. It may appear even when salinity is low.\nCertain other highly toxic elements occur in irrigation\nwater, especially drainage system discharge in some\nsoils. Most of these elements, i.e., selenium, arsenic,\nand mercury, are not necessarily toxic to plants, but\nin small concentrations are toxic to animal life.\nFigure 13–2 \tThreshold values of sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of topsoil and electrical conductivity of infiltrating water\n(eci ) associated with the likelihood of substantial losses in permeability\nSodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) in topsoil\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0 0 \t1 \t2 \t3 \t4 \t5 \t6\nArea of likely\npermeability hazard\nArea of unlikely\npermeability hazard\nElectrical conductivity of infiltrating water, (EC i) or (ECaw)",

    "content": "Part 652\nNational Irrigation Guide\nQuality of Water Supply\tChapter 13\n13–12 \t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\n(d) Sediment\nSuspended sediment and bedload material in an irriga-\ntion water supply can be a problem. Bedload material\nsettles when transport energy is reduced. Sediment\ncan plug water control structures in open and closed\nconveyance systems. Suspended sediment can be\nbeneficial, however, for sealing coarse soils in open\nchannel conveyance systems, on-farm ponds, and\nsome irrigated soils. As sediment is deposited with\neach irrigation and as tillage takes place, additional\nfines accumulate in the tillage depth. Soil available\nwater capacity (AWC) also increases in the surface\nlayer within the tillage depth.\nSuspended sediment that reduces soil intake rates on\ncoarse textured soils improves distribution uniformity\nwith surface irrigation systems (i.e., furrows and\nborders). Intake rates can be reduced under sprinkler\nsystems, causing surface water translocation and\nrunoff. Sediment in the water supply can cause wear\non pump impellers and sprinkler nozzles. In some\nextreme cases, sprinkler nozzles and bearings must be\nreplaced annually, or more often. Increased nozzle\ndischarge resulting from wear and abrasion must be\nconsidered when making water management deci-\nsions. A twist drill shank can be used to check nozzle\nwear. A nozzle is considered worn when a twist drill\nshank 1/64-inch larger than the stamped size on the\nnozzle can be inserted.\nWhen irrigation water containssuspended sediment,\nadditional settling, screening, and filtering is neces-\nsary for most micro irrigation systems, perhaps to the\npoint that makes management of micro irrigation\nimpractical. Settling basins of substantial size and\ncyclone sand separators can be used to reduce the\nsize and cost of filtering systems, especially when\nusing sand media filters. See Chapter 6, Irrigation\nSystem Design, for additional information on filtration\nand treatment requirements for micro systems.\n(e) Agricultural, industrial, and\nmunicipal wastes\nLand application of municipal, industrial, and agricul-\ntural wastes requires careful planning. The goal should\nbe to recycle nutrients in waste material as fertilizer,\nin amounts than can be used by the crop, and as a soil\namendment that will not degrade soil, water, plant,\nand air resources. In addition, the soil in the upper\npart of the profile is an ideal environment for micro-\nbiological activity to breakdown many undesirable\ncontaminants.\nBecause elements and nutrients can occur in high\nconcentrations, it is advisable to use these wastes as\nsupplemental irrigation water in a total water manage-\nment program. Adequate plant biomass and water\nmust be present to use applied nutrients. The irriga-\ntion decisionmaker should know the total chemical\nand nutrient content of applied wastes and know the\namount being applied with each application. For\nexample, most organic and agricultural wastes contain\nnitrates (NO3), phosphates (P 2O5), potash (K 2O), and,\nin the case of agricultural wastes, high amounts of\norganic material. All these nutrients are essential for\ngood crop growth. However, when applying agricul-\ntural wastes from dairy and other livestock operations\nto crops that don’t use all of these nutrients annually,\naccumulation in the soil profile can occur. This accu-\nmulation of excess nutrients can be a potential source\nof surface and ground water contamination especially\nwhen excess irrigation water is applied or when ex-\ncess precipitation occurs. Waste from food processing\noperations can contain high volumes of salt, organic\nmaterial, and other chemicals used in processing and\nbacteria control. Waste from confined livestock feed-\ning also contains salts from urine.\nA properly designed and operated sprinkler irrigation\nsystem can provide uniform waste application; how-\never, to achieve proper irrigation water management, a\nseparate application system may be required for\nirrigation. The type of application system depends\nupon the consistency of the waste and physical site\nconditions. Size of solids contained in waste affects\napplication patterns for each type of system. During\npumping, the concentration of solids may change with\ntime. In some cases, agitation or dilution of wastes\nbefore or during pumping may be required.",

    "content": "Part 652\nNational Irrigation Guide\nQuality of Water Supply\tChapter 13\n13–13\t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nManure and wastewater effluents containing less than\n5 percent solids are considered liquids. With proper\nscreening these wastes can be applied with almost any\nsprinkler or surface irrigation system. Application\nuniformity is a prime consideration. Pump intake\nscreens should be sized with openings no larger than\nthe smallest sprinkler orifice. Slurries containing 5 to\n15 percent solids require special pumping equipment\nand sprinklers with large nozzles (gun types). Slurries\ncan be transported by either tank wagon or pump and\npipeline. The viscosity and specific gravity of a slurry\nor liquid are dependent on the type and amount of\nsolids in suspension. Effects by variations in specific\ngravity should be evaluated on an individual basis.\nWaste containing trash, abrasives, bedding, or stringy\nmaterial is not suitable for sprinkle application unless\nit is preconditioned by chopping or grinding.\nWhere practical and suitable for soil conditions, it is\nrecommended slurries be diluted to a liquid consis-\ntency before application. Consult NEH, Part 651,\nAgricultural Waste Management Field Handbook\n(AWMFH), for quantities of water required to achieve\nspecific dilution requirements. Waste with 10 to 22\npercent solids content (semi-solid) can be transported\nand spread using box type spreaders and dump trucks.\nManure with more than 20 percent solids must be\nhandled as a solid waste. Separators can be used to\nremove solids from the liquid fraction. The liquids can\nthen be applied through most sprinkler systems. The\namount of water applied needs to be considered as a\npart of the total water budget. This is specially the\ncase with liquids and slurries. For more information\nsee the AWMFH.\nOrganic solids in liquid waste cause a decrease in\nspecific gravity, but a higher viscosity relative to that\nfor clean water. Changes in these fluid properties\nrequire net additional energy to overcome the effects\nof turbulence, velocity head, and pipe friction. The\nresult is an increase in friction head and horsepower\nrequirements. However, pipe friction typically reduces\nwith time. For liquid waste, AWMFH recommends\nusing the same friction factors as those for water, but\nto increase the power requirement by at least 10\npercent.\nThe effects of viscosity are most pronounced in pipe-\nlines when velocities are slow, solids content is high,\nor long pipelines are involved. Under these conditions,\na higher total dynamic head (TDH) is required than\nwhen pumping clean water. The overall effect is simi-\nlar to a throttling valve on the inlet pipeline at the\npump. For centrifugal pumps designed for water, the\nmotor will not overload because the decrease in flow\nrate tends to decrease horsepower requirement. How-\never, with an increase in viscosity, cavitation is more\nlikely to occur because of the higher required net\npositive suction head (NPSH). Cavitation occurs when\nNPSH available is less than required, leading to the\nformation of vapor pockets in the liquid, typically near\nthe eye of an impeller or around sharp obstructions in\nthe suction pipeline. The collapse of these pockets\ncauses the noise associated with cavitation (sounds\nlike gravel moving through a pump or steel pipeline).\nCavitation can damage the pump. The damaged area\nappears as corrosion.\nGenerally, where fluid velocities are greater than 3.5\nfeet per second and solids content less than 7 percent,\npipe friction can be assumed to be the same as that for\nwater. Any increase in fluid viscosity, however, creates\na higher required NPSH than for water. For pumping\nslurries, the pump dealer must be provided the percent\nsolids as well as the desired flow rate and pumping\nhead. NPSH should be evaluated for the most viscous\nfluid condition encountered during the pumping op-\neration. Pipe friction can be evaluated for the average\ncondition. Appropriate specialty pumping handbooks\nare recommended as a design aid to estimate pipe\nfriction for slurry flow and to calculate available\nNPSH.\nIf the same pump is used for pumping clean water and\nwater containing solids, the pump will operate at a\ndifferent efficiency for each liquid. Selecting the most\nefficient pump for dual application depends on deter-\nmining: total volume of clean water, total volume of\nwastewater, solids content of the wastewater, desired\nflow rate, and total dynamic head. Knowing these\nfactors allows the pump engineer or dealer to select a\npump that has the highest average efficiency for the\ntwo conditions.\n(1) Application rates and amounts\nTo avoid excessive runoff or ponding, application\nrates cannot exceed the soil intake rate and soil sur-\nface storage. Under sprinkler systems, exceeding the\nsoil intake rate and soil surface storage decreases\napplication uniformity resulting from translocation of\nwater on the ground surface. The result is low areas\nreceive disproportionate amounts of water and nutri-",

Design application rates should be guided by\nlocal experience and the maximum clean water appli-\ncation rate values displayed in chapter 2 of this guide.\nSoil intake characteristics for clean water and water\ncontaining waste are different.\nApplication of organic solids, contained in municipal,\nindustrial, and agricultural wastes reduces soil infiltra-\ntion rates. Appropriate management and associated\ncultural practices should be used to offset this effect\non most soils.\nMaximum quantities of waste application should be\nbased upon the seasonal crop nutrient requirement. In\naddition, waste applications should be timed such that\nthe applied nutrients are available when needed by the\ncrop. When the field receiving waste is irrigated, total\nwater applied (wastewater + effective precipitation +\nirrigation) should not exceed available soil-water\nstorage in the crop root zone. This avoids excess\nleaching and runoff.\nWater and nutrient budgets can be used as planning\ntools in evaluating this aspect. Crop evapotranspira-\ntion and net irrigation requirements for various crops\nare displayed in chapter 3. A nutrient analysis of the\nwaste and the knowledge of how much of each nutri-\nent is being applied are highly recommended to the\nirrigator. How the waste is handled, stored, and ap-\nplied somewhat dictates the availability of nitrates.\nNitrates can be easily lost to volatilization and denitri-\nfication, whereas through careful handling and appli-\ncation, more of the nitrates can be made available for\ncrop use.\n(i) Sprinkle irrigation systems—Both gun types\nand conventional sprinkler heads can be used for\napplication of liquid agricultural wastes. Large nozzle\ngun types are also well suited to application of waste\nslurries. Slurry application uniformity can be a prob-\nlem. Application systems can be continuous or peri-\nodic move. Screening is necessary when using conven-\ntional set type sprinkler systems, generally because\nthe nozzles used are smaller. With any system, lower\nflow rates (slower velocities) near the ends of laterals\ncan lead to the settling of solids. Pumping clean water\nfor 10 to 15 minutes following waste application helps\nto minimize this problem. Handmove systems are not\nrecommended for waste application because of the\nphysical contact with effluent. Pipelines should be\ndrained or protected from freezing during cold\nweather.\n(ii) Surface irrigation systems—Surface irriga-\ntion systems, typically furrows and borders, can be\nused to apply waste if good application uniformity of\nboth waste and water is obtained. Runoff and ponding\nmust be prevented. Runoff containing waste can\ncontaminate surface and ground water.\n(iii) \tMicro irrigation systems—Screening and\nfiltration requirements typically render micro irriga-\ntion systems unsuitable for most waste applications.\n(2) Major management concerns\nWaste should be applied uniformily and in a manner\nthat prevents runoff or excessive deep percolation.\nNutrients in applied waste should not exceed crop\nusage with allowance for application losses; i.e.,\ndenitrification. Proper application rates and timing are\nessential to meet these considerations. These con-\ncerns should be addressed in the selection and design\nof the irrigation application system and in the opera-\ntion and maintenance plan.\nWhere the goal is to maximize the utilization of nitro-\ngen, applying the waste in the first half of the irrigation\napplication period helps to incorporate the nitrogen\nand decrease denitrification losses. Where the goal is\nto protect ground water or surface water supplies\nfrom excess nitrogen, applying clean irrigation water\nbefore the waste increases volatilization losses and\nmaintains nitrogen in the upper part of the plant root\nzone. Both cases require good water management.\nApply only the amount of water the soil can hold\nwithin the plant root zone. Allow for expected precipi-\ntation.\nOdors from animal waste (manure) and some munici-\npal or industrial waste being applied through sprinkler\nsystems can be a major problem. Where possible,\nselect locations downwind from neighbors or heavily\ntraveled roadways. Avoid application on hot or humid\ndays or when the wind direction is toward these areas.\nVisiting with the neighbors regarding the least offen-\nsive time for applications is a good management\npractice.",

Depos-\nited solids can also dislodge during subsequent appli-\ncations to cause clogging of even the largest sprinkler\nnozzles. Clean water flushing also washes solids off\nplant leaves, preventing ammonia burn during hot\nweather.\nThe following management strategies may be appro-\npriate for protection of ground water from excess\ndeep percolation of nitrates:\n(i) Deficit irrigation—During the irrigation in\nwhich waste is applied, deficit irrigation (not com-\npletely filling the plant root zone) is a good manage-\nment practice. This reduces opportunity for deep\npercolation because of application nonuniformity. To\nuse this strategy, the operational flexibility of the\nirrigation system must accommodate a shorter time\nbetween irrigation applications. The amount of deficit\nirrigation should be based upon local precipitation\npatterns, crop rooting depth, and water holding capac-\nity of the soil.\n(ii) Reduced application—Apply only part of the\nwaste allowed for a single application, reserving the\nrest for a later application, but within the period in\nwhich the plants take up nitrogen and other nutrients.\nThe sum of nitrates and other nutrients for all the\napplications should not exceed the crop uptake after\nlosses are considered.\n(iii) Irrigation water before wastewater—Apply\nirrigation water before wastewater, reserving enough\nclean water for a 10- to 15-minute flush of pipelines.\nThis helps keep nitrates in the upper part of the plant\nroot zone.\n(3) Other management considerations\nProvide timely and correct maintenance of equipment is\na good management practice. Application of wastewater\nis frequently done during the non-irrigation season.\nWinter storage and maintenance are crucial factors in\nassuring that the system functions throughout the next\nseason. Rodents nesting in open pipes or control boxes,\nplugged pipelines, and undrained pipes that have frozen\nand burst are common problems.\nSee NEH, Part 651, Agricultural Waste Management\nField Handbook, Chapter 11, Land Utilization, for land\napplication of agricultural wastes through irrigation\nsystems.\nFor planning and design of land application of munici-\npal wastewater through irrigation systems, see the\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency’s\n(USEPA) publication, Process Design Manual, Land\nTreatment of Municipal Wastewater. October 1981\n(including Supplement on Rapid Infiltration and Over-\nland Flow, October 1984), EPA 625/1-81-013 and 013a.\nAdditional local design procedures and regulations\nmay also apply.\n(g) Miscellaneous\nOther water quality problems that may arise in specific\nlocations need to be considered when planning irriga-\ntion systems. They can include:\n• Extreme temperature water\n• Tailwater\n• Drainage effluent\n• Pesticides\n• Toxic ions (i.e., salts), heavy metals, and other\nelements not normally found in waste effluent\n(1) Extreme temperature (hot or cold) water\nGeothermal water can generally be used without\ncooling when using a moderate to high pressure\nsprinkle irrigation system. Water that is sprayed\nthrough the air will be close to or below ambient air\ntemperature when it strikes the ground surface or crop\ncanopy. When applying hot water through a low pres-\nsure sprinkler, micro, or surface irrigation system, the\nhot water generally must be cooled so that the plant\ncrown and tubers close to ground surface are not\ncooked. Pump design should consider water tempera-\nture where it is above 90 degrees Fahrenheit.\nGeothermal water may also contain undesirable chemi-\ncals, such as boron, chloride, sodium, sulfur, and heavy\nmetals. Therefore, a water quality test is necessary\nbefore using it for irrigation purposes. Some of these\nchemicals can be toxic to a wide variety of plants,\nanimals, and humans.\nIrrigating soils with extreme cold water (or excess\namounts of water) can delay soil warm-up, thereby\nretarding plant growth. In some areas glacier melt or",

A 4 to 8 degree Fahrenheit decrease in soil\ntemperature in the upper 6 to 8 inches of the soil\nprofile have been measured after applying 3 inches of\n54 degree Fahrenheit water with surface systems. This\ntemporary drop in soil temperature may be short (4 to\n16 hours), but it can retard plant growth during the\ncool down period. Sprinkle irrigation can help warm\ncold water if ambient air temperature is higher than\nthe temperature of the water. Applying too much\nirrigation water early in the growing season (or for\nfrost protection when the ground surface is bare) can\nretard plant growth because of excess soil surface\nevaporation and excessive water in the plant root\nzone.\n(2) Tailwater (surface runoff)\nWhere the opportunity exists and is legal, tailwater\nfrom irrigated fields can be reused as a water supply\nor to supplement existing supplies. Runoff water from\nirrigation can contain nutrients, sediment, pesticides,\nand in some areas nematodes. Use of water containing\nthese contaminants may be restricted. For example,\nrunoff from a field irrigation system used to apply\nfertilizers and pesticides cannot be used on fresh\nvegetables, but can be used on many field crops. It is\npreferred to reuse this water for irrigation of field\ncrops rather than allow it to return to public water.\nTailwater reuse can improve onfarm irrigation effi-\nciency and reduce use of high quality water.\nSediment in tailwater, often resulting from irrigation\ninduced erosion on highly erosive soils, can degrade\ndownstream surface water for public recreation,\nmunicipal water supply, wildlife, and fishery uses. It\nmay also be undesirable for irrigation purposes be-\ncause of sediment deposition problems in conveyance\nsystems. Technically, tailwater reuse on the same or\ndownslope field should be a part of every surface\nirrigation system. Except for closed level basin, bor-\nder, or furrow systems, runoff is necessary for best\nirrigation uniformity. Blocked ends can improve\napplication uniformity on nearly level fields where\nponded water covers the lower fourth to third of the\nfield. On steeper fields, blocking furrows and borders\nto limit runoff generally increases deep percolation.\nLevel furrows and basins in arid areas typically have\nno runoff.\n(3) Drainage effluent\nInternal drainage and removal of drainage water used\nfor leaching (for salinity control) are essential. How-\never, disposal of effluent can be a problem. Disposal\nalternatives include:\n• Discharge into salt sinks (ocean, salt basins,\nunderground saline aquifers)\n• Discharge into a waste disposal operation.\n• Reuse on cropland by irrigating high salt-\ntolerant plants.\n• Discharge into an onfarm evaporation pond\n• Reclaim salt(s) for use in the United States salt\nmarket (livestock feed, food processing for\nhuman consumption, industrial).\nBy far the best solution is good onsite water manage-\nment to minimize the amount of effluent to be dis-\nposed, but yet maintain proper soil salinity control in\nthe plant root zone. Drainage effluent can contain\nnaturally occurring soil elements. Some of these\nelements (i.e., boron, selenium) can be toxic to wild-\nlife.\nDrainage effluent from salinity control irrigation\nmanagement can contain high concentrations of salts\nand is unsuitable for reuse on most common crops. It\nhas been demonstrated, however, that drainage efflu-\nent from fields with intensive salinity control can be\nused for irrigation of very high salt-tolerant plants\n(agroforestry). Incorporating crop residue containing\nsalt returns the salt to the soil, perhaps with very little,\nif any, net salt removal. Some of these plants are\ncommercially useful and can be grown economically\nand irrigated with very high salt concentration drain-\nage effluent. When irrigating high salt-tolerant plants,\ngood internal drainage and removal of excess water\nused for leaching for salinity management are also\nessential. The final, smaller volume of drainage efflu-\nent with a very high salt concentration is typically\ndischarged into an onfarm evaporation pond. The\nremaining salts can then be mined. High salt-tolerant\nplants are listed in table 13–4.",

Many environmental concerns are local.\nSome are larger in scope; such as coastal zones, river\nbasins, and regional and even international. Irrigation\nplanners and decisionmakers need to have a basic\nunderstanding of the general processes by which\nirrigation water can affect soil, water, air, plant, and\nanimal resources. Human considerations (social,\ncultural, and economic) should involve both present\nand future conditions.\nMost farmers are good environmentalists. They are\nfaithful stewards of soil, water, air, plant, and animal\nresources, and truly desire to help maintain a good\noverall environment and quality of life. Others, many\nof whom recognize only one or a few specific re-\nsources, should have concerns for environmental\nquality and long-term farm production.\n652.1401 \tEnvironmental\nimpacts\nNegative and positive environmental impacts are\ncaused by irrigation. These impacts include:\n• Transport of chemicals\n• Consumptive use by plants\n• Pollution hazards by fertilizers, pesticides,\nfuels, and other contaminants\n• Obstructed wildlife migration patterns\nNegative irrigation impacts to the environment can be\ninsignificant or large. Water pollution problems from\nindividual irrigated farms may appear small, but when\ncombined with adjacent farms, the problem can be\nlarge. With new project development or major changes\nto existing systems, mitigation may be necessary.\nProviding an environmental assessment as part of the\nirrigation system planning process can identify both\nnegative and positive impacts. Farmer’s irrigation\ndecisions should be based on knowing potential im-\npacts and how much they affect the environment. See\nchapter 15 for planning tools including environmental\nassessment aids.\n(a) Transport of chemicals\nWater can transport chemicals through the soil and off\nthe field. Inefficient and nonuniform onfarm irrigation\ncan provide excess surface water runoff (tailwater)\nand deep percolation. For best uniformity, some deep\npercolation is generally required.\nRunoff water from irrigation can carry sediment from\nsoil erosion, nutrients, pesticides, animal waste, and\nother soil surface pollutants into surface water. Runoff\nfrom irrigation can augment surface water flows to\nprovide water for fish, wildlife, irrigated areas, and\nother downslope land uses, such as wetlands. How-\never, in most cases quality of water from irrigation\nrunoff is lower than that of the original supply. Pollut-\nants can result in damages to other downslope irri-\ngated areas, to fish, wildlife habitat, cities, and indus-\ntries.",

Runoff from irrigated cropland is\ndesignated by EPA as a nonpoint source pollutant;\ntherefore, discharges do not require a discharge per-\nmit. Deep percolation can carry nutrients and pesti-\ncides that have become a part of the soil-water solu-\ntion to local ground water aquifers. Certain chemicals\ncontained in ground water can become hazardous\nwhen consumed by humans and livestock. Irrigation\nwater can help metabolize wastes applied to land into\nplant usable nutrients and soil amendments.\n(b) Consumptive use by plants\nWater consumptively used by plants is not available\nfor other instream uses. To understand the impacts on\ninstream flows, ground water, and springs, consump-\ntive use, nonconsumptive use, and local water right\nlaws must be understood as they apply to mining and\nto agricultural, municipal, and industrial uses.\n(c) Pollution hazards by chemicals\nCare in handling and storage of fertilizers, pesticides,\nfuels, lubricants, and solvents is necessary to avoid\npolluting ground and surface water. This applies to\nboth commercial and on-farm operations. Care must\nbe taken to prevent chemical and fuel spills at chemi-\ncal and fuel storage facilities, chemical mixing areas,\nchemical application equipment wash areas, and\nespecially at the irrigation pumping plant site. Spills of\nthese materials onto the ground surface can infiltrate\nthe soil or be flushed off the surface with irrigation\nwater or precipitation.\n(d) Impacts to wildlife\nSome open channel irrigation water conveyance\nsystems can obstruct normal wildlife migration pat-\nterns. Large concrete lined canals are hazardous to\nsome wildlife (also humans and domestic pets) unless\nprecautions are planned and incorporated so that they\ncan exit once they have entered (by choice or acciden-\ntally). This is a concern in arid areas where the canal\nwater may be the only water available for some dis-\ntance.\nIn some areas, canal seepage and deep percolation in\nfields can dissolve naturally occurring toxic soil ele-\nments, such as salts and selenium. The toxic elements\nin the soil-water solution can then move into ground\nand surface water.",

Even the best irrigation system can be\nmismanaged. Well planned and fully implemented\nirrigation water, animal waste, pest, and nutrient\nmanagement plans reduce or help prevent ground\nwater and surface water quality pollution problems\nassociated with irrigation. Proper irrigation water\nmanagement includes:\n• An irrigation system that is suitable to the site.\n• Good irrigation system operation techniques\nthat optimize distribution uniformity.\n• Proper irrigation scheduling and adequate\nirrigation system maintenance.\n652.1403 \tPollution deliv-\nery process\nThe process by which a pollutant is detached and\ndelivered to ground or surface water (and into air)\ntakes place in three basic stages: availability, detach-\nment, and transport. A water pollution hazard exists\nonly when a pollutant is available in some form at\nthe field site, becomes detached, and is transported\nto a receiving water body.\nPollution concerns from irrigation activities result\nfrom using an unsuitable irrigation system, using poor\noperation techniques, or making poor irrigation water\nmanagement decisions, especially when matching\nirrigation applications to pesticide and fertilizer appli-\ncations. However, if excess fertilizers and persistent\npesticides are available, a potential pollution opportu-\nnity exists even when good irrigation water manage-\nment is practiced.\n(a) Availability\nPollutant materials must be available in a form that\nhas the potential to become a concern. The quantity\nand nature of the material influence its availability.\nFor example, soil is usually available to provide sedi-\nment downstream, either as deposition or suspended\nparticles. Chemicals, fertilizers, and pesticides vary\nnot only in quantity, but in degree of their availability.\nAvailability is often measured in half life (half life is\nwhen 50 percent of the original chemical is still avail-\nable).\nThe amount and placement of chemicals (availability)\nat the time a runoff or deep percolation event occurs\nare significant. The partitioning of a chemical between\nwater and soil determines its availability to be carried\nby soil erosion, by deep percolation, or by some other\npathway.\nPhosphate placed on the soil surface can be present in\nsurface runoff. If placed below the soil surface, phos-\nphates are typically not available except when severe\nsoil erosion takes place. Nitrates that have leached\nbelow the plant root zone are available for deep perco-\nlation. Manure left on the soil surface is available as a",

The detachment process\nis either physical or chemical. Chemical pollutants are\ngrouped into three basic categories based on their\nsorption characteristics: strongly sorbed, moderately\nsorbed, nonsorbed. Sorption refers to absorbed and\nadsorbed chemicals.\nAbsorption, dissolving and detachment of chemicals in\nthe soil mass and water, is dependent on:\n• Type of chemical and concentration in soil\nwater solution\n• Strength of ionic bonding to soil particles\n• Quality of irrigation water and soil-water solu-\ntion as to type and concentration of chemicals\n(salinity, pH), soil texture, organic matter\ncontent, soil erodibility, temperature, biological\nactivity, pesticide persistence\nThe negative impact of applying chemicals (and water)\ncan be minimized by using a suitable irrigation system\nwith good operation techniques and proper irrigation\nwater management. Suitability generally refers to how\nuniform a planned amount of water can be applied\nacross a field.\nHighly soluble chemicals are easily detached (by\ndissolving or being released) by surface runoff and by\nwater percolating through the soil. Because of strong\nionic bonding to soil particles, phosphorus moves\nprimarily with soil particles in surface runoff. The\nquantities and kinds of chemicals adsorbed to sedi-\nment are affected by soil chemistry, amount and\navailability of chemical(s), and amount of soil erosion\nthat occurs. Solid particles are physically detached by\nsprinkler droplets (and raindrops) and by surface\nrunoff (shear stress). Coarse soil materials are easily\ndetached, but do not transport readily except on\nsteeper slopes. Manure on the soil surface is easily\ndetached. Fine soil materials are more resistant to\ndetachment, but once detached are readily trans-\nported.\n(c) Transport\nWith respect to irrigation, agricultural pollutants are\ntypically transported in water as surface runoff or\ndeep percolation. However, some substances are lost\nthrough wind drift and volatilization when using\nsprinkle irrigation systems for chemigation or applica-\ntion of liquid waste or manure slurry. Manure on the\nsoil surface can be transported in field runoff as solid\nparticles in suspension or as part of the water solution.\nThe particular pathway by which a pollutant leaves the\nfield depends on the soil, hydrology of the field, irriga-\ntion system used, and level of irrigation water manage-\nment. Timing and rates of fertilizer and pesticide\napplication (including the relationship to irrigation\napplications) and the interaction of the applied chemi-\ncal with water and soil are also important.\nPollutants are generally transported to receiving water\nby surface runoff and deep percolation. Practicing\ngood water management provides little opportunity for\napplied and naturally occurring chemical and organic\nwastes to move with surface runoff or through the soil\nprofile to ground water. Some runoff from graded\nfurrow and border irrigation systems is necessary to\nmake the most uniform application of irrigation water\nto all parts of the field.\nIn practice, deep percolation and lateral translocation\ncan occur with all irrigation methods and systems\nexcept subirrigation where water movement is prima-\nrily upward. Where operation and management of the\nsystem are poor, excess deep percolation and runoff\nprobably have the best opportunity to occur with\nsurface irrigation methods. However, it should be\nstrongly emphasized that when adequately designed,\noperated, maintained and managed, surface irrigation\nsystems can provide good uniformity and low pollu-\ntion potential. A poorly designed, operated, main-\ntained, and managed micro or sprinkle irrigation\nsystem also has high potential for providing excess\ndeep percolation and runoff.\nDeep percolation carries dissolved substances, such as\nnitrates or pesticides in original form or in a metabo-\nlized form. The metabolized form of some chemicals\ncan have a much longer half-life than the original\nchemical and may be either less or more toxic or\nmobile in the soil-water solution.",

Table 14–1\ndisplays examples of the more common pollutants. All\ncan be transported by water, and a few can be trans-\nported by air. Odors associated with organic and\ninorganics are definitely problems to people, and\nirrigation activities (both water and air) can be the\ncarrier. Examples include sprinkle application of\nanimal waste, sprinkle and aerial application of pesti-\ncides, volatilization of nitrogen in urea, and ammonia\nforms from animal waste and fertilizers.\nAt a soil-water nitrogen concentration of 20 ppm (20\nmg/L), each acre-inch of deep percolation represents\nabout 5 pounds of nitrate-nitrogen lost per acre. Apply-\ning fertilizer in excess of plant needs, along with over\nirrigation on all or parts of a field, is perhaps the\ngreatest cause of ground water and surface water\npollution. Where ground water is used as an irrigation\nwatet source, it can also be a valuable source for\nsupplying nitrate needs for crop growth. With an\nannual irrigation application rate of 24 inches per acre,\nand 20 ppm, this resource can provide approximately\n120 pounds of nitrate-nitrogen per acre.

An adequately designed, operated,\nmaintained, and managed irrigation system is essential\nfor minimizing pollution potential. Applying the cor-\nrect amount of water according to crop needs is a\nnecessary part of proper irrigation water management\nfor controlling pollution.\n(a) Pollution control\n(1) Reduction of source\nSource reduction is reducing availability of chemicals\nthrough proper nutrient and pest management.\n(i) Nutrient management—Less fertilizer is gener-\nally applied if a nutrient management plan is followed.\nA soil testing program can show residual amounts of\nfertilizer available, thereby avoiding overapplication.\nThis reduces the extra that was historically applied to\naccount for losses and helps balance the total fertilizer\nneeds and availability (including residual amounts in\nthe soil profile) for average crop yield, not maximum\nyield.\n(ii) Pest management—Less pesticide is generally\napplied if a pest management plan is followed. Evalua-\ntion of soil, site conditions, application methods, and\nthe choice of pesticide is stressed to reduce hazards of\npotential pollution. Application of pesticides should be\ncoordinated with irrigation applications to allow\nnecessary time to be effective in controlling pests\nwithout being washed from the surface of leaves by\nspray. Better control and timing of application typi-\ncally results in less pesticide use with chemigation.\nField scouting techniques and proper pesticide appli-\ncation timing and rates based on pest threshold levels\ncan reduce potential for leaching and runoff.\nUsing SCS SCHEDULER software, or some other\ntechnique, to calculate growing degree days can re-\nduce the amount of pesticide applied by more accu-\nrately predicting insect hatch and propagation.\n(2) Reduction of availability\nThe irrigation decisionmaker can optimize nutrient\navailability by:\n• Managing fertilizer through proper rates and\ntiming\n• Monitoring the buildup of available nutrients in\nthe crop root zone\n• Incorporating fertilizers\n• Using proper irrigation water management\nWhere excess nitrates have accumulated in the soil\nprofile below normal rooting depths for shallow\nrooted crops normally grown, then salvage crops with\ndeep rooting characteristics should be grown until the\naccumulation of nitrates is consumed. Minimization of\ndeep percolation losses is essential.\n(3) Reduction in detachment\nThe loss of nutrients and pesticides by detachment of\nsoil particles (i.e., erosion) is important for inorganic\nchemicals whose major environmental chemical forms\nare strongly or weakly held by soil particles. Phospho-\nrus is tightly bonded to soil particles; therefore, it is\nnot readily detachable except where soil is detached\nby water erosion. Phosphorus becomes part of the\nsurface water pollution process mostly as a result of\nprecipitation, runoff, irrigation related soil erosion,\nsediment deposition, and suspended sediment in\nsurface water.\nIncreased soil organic matter decreases the potention\nfor detachment of nutrients and pesticides. Decreasing\ndeep percolation losses can decrease nitrate move-\nment. Inorganic forms of nitrogen are not tightly\nbonded to soil particles. They dissolve easily and\nreadily become part of the soil-water solution. Nitrates\nare very mobile and move readily with deep percola-\ntion as part of the soil-water solution.\nErosion control is an essential component of a re-\nsource plan.

Chemicals that\ndissolve readily are transported easily with excess\nirrigation water. Reducing deep percolation by using\nadequately designed, operated, maintained, and man-\naged irrigation systems is essential to reducing trans-\nport potential. Chemigation near the end of an irriga-\ntion application helps keep chemicals near the soil\nsurface.\nPhosphorus typically is transported with detached and\ntransported soil particles in surface runoff because of\nstrong bonding with soil particles. Reduced irrigation\ninduced soil erosion on the field and opportunity for\noff-field transport of sediment are essential. Onfield\nsoil erosion with furrow irrigation systems can be\ncontrolled by:\n• Using proper furrow inflow streams, reducing\nirrigation grades\n• Maintaining crop residue on the soil surface\nwith adequate crop rotations and conservation\ntillage methods and equipment\n• Reducing tillage operations\nWhere onsite erosion control practices are adequate,\noff-field sediment movement can be reduced with\nvegetative filter strips at the lower end of fields and by\ninstalling and maintaining sediment collection basins.\nOn highly erosive soil, often the only solution to elimi-\nnate irrigation induced erosion and resulting pollution\nmay be changing to permanent vegetative crops (grass,\nalfalfa-grass, and clover-grass) or collecting and redis-\ntributing sediment. Almost all soils contain some clay\nparticles. Colloidal clays stay in suspension much\nlonger than do silts and sands; therefore, overflow\nfrom sediment ponds can contribute to downstream\nsuspended sediment pollution.\nMaintaining ground cover to filter potential pollutants\nand prevent soil erosion can provide a reduction of\nchemical availability, detachment, and transport.\nImplementing necessary component practices identi-\nfied in resource plans, such as conservation tillage\nhelps maintain crop residue on soil surface and im-\nprove soil condition. Vegetative cover and water\nmanagement practices can reduce or eliminate irri-\ngated related soil erosion. Plant and maintain vegeta-\ntive filter strips at lower end of irrigated fields to\nreduce water velocity and to filter sediment. Also\nconsider using sediment collection basins at lower end\nof fields as a best management practice.\n(5) Controlling pollution from animal waste\nAnimal waste (manure) is a valuable resource for crop\nproduction. It contains not only nutrients, but also\norganic material. A basic principle is that if animal\nwaste is used to the maximum extent possible, few\npollutants are discharged to receiving water. Animal\nwaste is applied as liquids, slurries, or solids.\nA properly designed, operated, maintained, and man-\naged waste management system reduces or eliminates\ndeep percolation and surface runoff of applied nutri-\nents. A properly designed, operated, maintained, and\nmanaged irrigation system is often a part of waste\nmanagement systems. In some cases. two separate\nsystems may be necessary.\nRunoff from waste application should be nonexistent.\nVegetative filters at the lower end of fields efficiently\ntrap water transported waste particles with attached\nnutrients and allow more time for infiltration of runoff.\nFilter strips must be used in combination with other\napplied practices.\nLittle (if any) reduction in water soluble nutrients and\nchemicals is experienced by surface water passing\nthrough and leaving a filter strip. Water quality prob-\nlems related to animal waste application sites can be\neffectively solved by using water management prac-\ntices that reduce the availability of pollutants for\ntransport during runoff events. These practices in-\nclude:\n• Providing a suitable site (crop, soils, and slope)\n• Applying waste with a suitable irrigation system\n• Not exceeding soil intake rate(s)\n• Providing proper timing of waste application\n• Providing uniform waste and water applications\n(i) Application rates—The rate at which animal\nwaste is applied should be based on soil nutrient\nlevels, nutrient needs of the crop, and available nutri-\nents in the waste. Both nitrate and phosphorous re-\nquirements should be considered in determining\nproper application rates.",

Waste efflu-\nent should be applied at a rate less than that of the soil\ninfiltration (plus surface storage) rate for the effluent\nbeing applied. Split application also helps.\n(ii) Timing of waste applications—To maximize\nplant use and reduce potential for deep percolation\nand runoff losses, applications of animal waste should\ncoincide as nearly as possible with crop needs. Suffi-\ncient water must be available to optimize plant use of\napplied waste.\nRate and timing of waste applications with an irriga-\ntion system can be controlled by the kind and amount\nof nutrients in the waste or by the amount of water\napplied. Typically waste application should occur near\nthe end of the irrigation set. Waste applications during\nnongrowing seasons should be controlled by the\ncapacity of the soil profile containing plant roots to\nstore both the applied nutrients and water. Surface\nincorporation of wastes also helps.\n(iii) Frequency of waste application—The fre-\nquency of waste applications can vary considerably.\nDuring the irrigation season, waste applications\nshould coincide with planned irrigations. Liquid waste\nhigh in phosphates should be applied in the first part\nof the irrigation application period to allow infiltration.\nAnimal waste high in nitrates should be applied near\nthe end of the irrigation set. Clear water should pass\nthrough the system for 5 to 15 minutes following waste\napplication to purge the irrigation system of waste\nmaterial and to wash off plants. In either case, the\namount of applied water should not exceed the capac-\nity of the soil to store applied water within the plant\nroot zone.\n(6) Tools for planning and followup\nPortable state-of-art test kits and instruments for field\nuse are readily available. They can be extremely useful\nas planning and application tools that provide almost\ninstantaneous information. Examples of field instru-\nments and uses are:\n• Determining soil and irrigation water salinity\nlevels; i.e. electrical conductivity of soil-water\nextract (EC e) and irrigation water (ECi ).\n• Determining nitrogen content of animal waste.\n• Quick readings of in situ soil moisture; i.e.,\nneutron moisture gauges (probes), tensiom-\neters, TDR probes, electrical resistance blocks,\nfeel and appearance of soil, and Speedy Mois-\nture Meter.\n• Determining sediment concentration in surface\nrunoff using Imhoff cones.\n• Quickly and easily determining stream flow\nusing digital current meters.\n• Measuring stream flow depth using resistance\ntapes or pressure transducers.\n• Collecting, storing, and transferring field data\nusing data loggers.\n• Providing on-the-spot analysis and information\nusing laptop computers and portable printers.",

The scoping process\nshould involve multidiscipline professionals.\nFor project level planning, the scoping process should\ninvolve landowners, public, community leaders, agen-\ncies at all government levels, and interested technical\npeople. Concerns having less importance can be\nscoped out early. Institutionalized concerns should be\naddressed. Scoping helps to determine the level of\ninformation needed.

In semiarid,\nsubhumid, and humid areas, supplemental irrigation\nhelps assure an economic crop yield and quality dur-\ning periods of less than adequate precipitation. In arid\nareas, most crops cannot be economically grown\nwithout irrigation water. Irrigation can reduce the\npotential for pollution in subhumid and humid areas\nby maintaining plant growth during periods of less\nthan adequate precipitation.\nRanch livestock capacity and associated economic\noperations are often controlled by quantity and quality\nof feed harvested from irrigated fields.\nIrrigation of high salt tolerant plants with high saline\n(or sodic) subsurface drainage effluent provides a\nwise alternative use of an otherwise potential pollut-\nant. Irrigation systems can transport and apply agricul-\ntural and municipal wastes for disposal on irrigated\ncropland, landscaping, or turf. A larger volume of\nwastes can be used by irrigated crops than\nnonirrigated crops because of the higher use of nutri-\nents.

Irrigation aids plant growth during high wind\nperiods, but only during the plant growing season.\nApplying water for preventing wind erosion, as a\nsingle practice to provide a wet surface to increase\nerosion resistance, is short lived.

Monetary value of cumulative effects is\ntypically more difficult to determine.\nIrrigation system improvements, improved irrigation\nwater management, and proper nutrient and pesticide\nmanagement can typically relate to:\n• Decreased water requirement, which equates to\nreduced diversion requirements reduced pump-\ning costs, reduced water purchased, and re-\nduced system capacity requirement.\n• Decreased use of fertilizers.\n• Decreased use of pesticides.\n• Increased yield or higher product quality, or\nboth.\nDecreased irrigation induced soil erosion relates to:\n• Maintaining long-term soil productivity.\n• Decreased maintenance costs for removal of\ndeposited sediment in runoff collection drains,\nponds, roadside ditches, and in water convey-\nance systems.\n• Decreased use of fertilizer.\n• Decreased use of pre-emergence herbicides.",

The preceding irrigation schedule can be used as a guide to\ndetermine when to irrigate. It is a guide only for average month and year conditions. Optimizing use of rainfall to reduce unnecessary\nirrigations during the growing season is a good management practice. In semi-humid and humid areas, it is recommended to not replace\n100 percent of the soil moisture depletion each irrigation. Leave room in the plant root zone for containing water infiltration from rainfall\nevents. This will vary with location, frequency, and amount of rainfall occurring during the growing season. It should be approximately\n0.5 to 1.0 inches.\nMaintaining to a higher soil moisture level (MAD) typically does not require more irrigation water for the season, just more frequent\nsmaller irrigations. This is especially true with crops such as root vegetables, potatoes, onions, garlic, mint, and sweet corn.\nThe attached chart for evaluating soil moisture by the feel and appearance method can be used to help determine when to irrigate.\nOther common methods to monitor crop water use and soil moisture include: plant signs (crop critical moisture stress periods),\natmometer, evaporation pan (applying appropriate factors), tensiometers, electrical resistance blocks (moisture blocks), and crop water\nstress index (CWSI gm).\nNRCS (SCS) - SCHEDULER computer software is available to provide calculations of daily crop evapotranspiration when used with\nlocal daily weather station values. On-site rainfall data is necessary to determine effective rainfall, whereas local weather station rainfall\ndata is not sufficiently accurate due to spatial variability. Current rainfall and soil moisture data can be input manually or electronically to\nassist in predicting when irrigation is needed.\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\nNatural Resources Conservation Service\nIrrigation Water Management Plan— Sprinkler Irrigation System—\nContinued\nNAME ________________________________________ DATE __________________________ PREPARED BY _______________________________________\nPage 2 of 3\nIrrigation scheduling Information\nMonth\nMonthly net1\nirrigation\nrequirement\n(inches)\nCrop evapo-\ntranspiration\nuse rate\n(in/day)\nIrrigation\nfrequency\nneeded\n(days)\nAverage2\nnumber of\nIrrigations\nneeded\nApril\nMay\nJune\nJuly\nAugust\nSeptember\nOctober\nTotal\n1 Net irrigation requirement (NIR) represents crop evapotranspiration less effective rainfall.\n2 Assuming a full soil profile at start of season.

    "content": "Part 652\nIrrigation Guide\nResource Planning and Evaluation\nTools and Worksheets\nChapter 15\n15–23\t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nA properly operated, maintained, and managed sprinkle irrigation system is an asset to your farm. Your system was designed\nand installed to apply irrigation water to meet the needs of the crop without causing erosion, runoff, and losses to deep\npercolation. The estimated life span of your system is 15 years. The life of the system can be assured and usually increased\nby developing and carrying out a good operation and maintenance program.\nPollution hazards to ground and surface water can be minimized when good irrigation water management practices are\nfollowed. Losses of irrigation water to deep percolation and runoff should be minimized. Deep percolation and runoff from\nirrigation can carry nutrients and pesticides into ground and surface water. Avoiding spills from agricultural chemicals, fuels,\nand lubricants. will also minimize potential pollution hazards to ground and surface water.\nLeaching for salinity control may be required if electrical conductivity of the irrigation water or soil water exceeds plant toler-\nance for your yield and quality objectives. If this condition exists on your field(s), a salinity management plan should be\ndeveloped.\nThe following are system design information and recommendations to help you develop an operation and maintenance plan\n(see irrigation system map for layout):\n• \taverage operating pressure = \tlb/in2 (use a pressure gage to check operating pressure)\n• \tnozzle size = \tinch (use shank end of high speed drill bit to check nozzle wear)\n• \taverage sprinkler head discharge \tgpm\n• \tsprinkler head rotation speed should be 1 - 2 revolutions per minute\n• \tsprinkler head spacing on lateral = \tft; outlet valve spacing on main line \tft\n• \tlateral, number(s) \t, \tft, \tinch diameter ______________________\n• \tmain line = \tft \tinch diameter, type \t, class _______________\n• \tpump = \t, \tgpm @ \tft Total Dynamic Head (TDH)\nMake sure that all measuring devices, valves, sprinkler heads, surface pipeline, and other mechanical parts of the system are\nchecked periodically and worn or damaged parts are replaced as needed. Always replace a worn or improperly functioning\nnozzle with design size and type. Sprinkler heads operate efficiently and provide uniform application when they are plumb, in\ngood operating condition, and operate at planned pressure. Maintain all pumps, piping, valves, electrical and mechanical\nequipment in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. Check and clean screens and filters as necessary to prevent\nunnecessary hydraulic friction loss and to maintain water flow necessary for efficient pump operation.\nProtect pumping plant and all associated electrical and mechanical controls from damage by livestock, rodents, insects, heat,\nwater, lightning, sudden power failure, and sudden water source loss. Provide and maintain good surface drainage to prevent\nwater pounding around pump and electrical equipment. Assure all electrical/gas fittings are secure and safe. Always replace\nworn or excessively weathered electric cables and wires and gas tubing and fittings when first noticed. Check periodically for\nundesirable stray currents and leaks. Display appropriate bilingual operating instructions and warning signs as necessary.\nDuring non-seasonal use, drain pipelines and valves, secure and protect all movable equipment (i.e. wheel lines).\nIf you need help developing your operation and maintenance plan, contact your local USDA Natural Resources Conservation\nService office for assistance.\nU.S. Department of Agriculture \tPage 3 of 3\nNatural Resources Conservation Service\nIrrigation Water Management Plan—Sprinkler Irrigation System—Continued\nNAME \tDATE \tPREPARED BY _________________________",

    "content": "15–111\t(210-vi-NEH, September 1997)\nEstimating Soil\nMoisture by\nFeel and Appearance\nNatural\nResources\nConservation\nService\nIrrigation Water Management (IWM) is applying water\naccording to crop needs in an amount that can be\nstored in the plant zone of the soil.\nThe feel and appearance method is one of several\nirrigation scheduling methods used in IWM. It is a way\nof monitoring soil moisture to determine when to\nirrigate and how much water to apply. Applying too\nmuch water may cause excessive runoff and/or deep\npercolation. As a result, nutrients and chemicals may\nbe lost or leached into the ground water.\nIn applying this method, you determine the amount of\nirrigation water needed by subtracting water in soil\nstorage (estimated using the feel and appearance\nmethod) from the available water capacity (AWC) of\nthe soil. (See the example computation below.)\nThe feel and appearance of soil varies with texture\nand moisture content. Water available for plant use\ncan be estimated, with experience, to an accuracy of\nabout 5 percent. Soil moisture is typically sampled in\n1-foot increments to the root depth of the crop at\nthree or more sites per field. You vary the number of\nsample sites and depths according to: crop, field size,\nsoil texture, and soil stratification. For each sample\nthe feel and appearance method involves:\n1. Obtaining a soil sample at the selected depth using\na probe, auger, or shovel;\n2. Squeezing the soil sample firmly in your hand\nseveral times to form an irregularly shaped ball;\n3. Observing soil texture, ability to ribbon, firmness\nand surface roughness of ball, water glistening,\nloose soil particles, soil/water staining on fingers,\nand soil color;\n4. Comparing observations with photographs and/or\nchart to estimate percent water available. (Note: A\nvery weak ball disintegrates with one bounce of\nthe hand. A weak ball disintegrates with 2 to 3\nbounces.)\nExample for a uniform soil\nSample \tUSDA \tField \tAWC for \tWater \tWater\ndepth \tZone \ttexture \tcapacity* \tlayer \tavailable \tneed\n(inches) \t(inches) \t(percent) \t(inches) \t(inches) \t(inches)\n6 \t0-12 \tsandy loam \t30 \t1.4 \t.42 \t.98\n18 \t12-24 \tsandy loam \t45 \t1.4 \t.63 \t.77\n30 \t24-36 \tloam \t60 \t2.0 \t1.20 \t.80\n42 \t36-48 \tloam \t75 \t2.0 \t1.50 \t.50\n6.8 \t3.75 \t3.05\n* Determined by feel and appearance method\nSummary of estimation\n(inches)\nAWC in 48” root zone at 100% field capacity ............................................................................................................ 6.8\nActual water available for plant use ......................................................................................................................... 3.7\nNet irrigation requirement or need ........................................................................................................................... 3.1",

It indicates that\nhuge increase in the production of agricultural commodities\nbut there is not increased standard of living of farmers\nwith compare to increase in production. The main reason\nbehind this is farmers not given due attention to marketing\nof agricultural produce. Neither the Governments at Central\nand State levels, nor the farmers gave due importance to\nagricultural marketing. As on date, Indian farmers are well\nversed with production technologies but they are not so in\nmarketing. Market information and intelligence are crucial\nto enable farmers and traders to make informed decisions\nabout what to grow, when to harvest, to which markets\nproduce should be sent, and whether to store it or not. The\nmost important marketing intelligence need of the farmer is\nprice intelligence. Efficient market information can be shown\nto have positive benefit for farmers and traders. Up-to-date\ninformation on prices and other market factors enables\nfarmers to negotiate with the traders and also facilitates\nspatial distribution of products from rural to urban areas and\nbetween markets. Very few farmers participate in commercial\nmarkets due to lack of access to market information and\nunderstanding as to how the market operates. It is not enough\nfor marketing information to be collected; it must also be\ndisseminated in a form accessible to farmers and adopted\nto their needs. Recent tremendous growth in information\ntechnology is making it more feasible to provide farmers with\nthe marketing information they need. However, farmers may\nnot benefit from sophisticated facilities, if the system is poorly\nmanaged or not designed for their needs. In India existing\nagricultural market information services frequently fall short\nin one or more areas. Though farm related information has\nbeen provided by the Radio, TV and Newspapers, there was\nno mechanism to analyze, interpret and convert this vast\nvolume of information into simple, comprehensible trade\nintelligence. This calls for a farmer friendly, easily accessible\nmarket intelligence system.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo know the market intelligence in agriculture and\nallied business\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe information required to prepare this material\nprincipally come from various reports, documents and web site\nresources. The information has been analyzed to illustrate the\nuse of market intelligence, describe the underlying concepts\nand generate lessons, ideas, and insights useful for developing\nand strengthening agriculture marketing intelligence in our\nMARKET INTELLIGENCE IN AGRICULTURE AND ALLIED BUSINESS\nReshma Balu Shinde\nAssistant Professor, College of Agri-Business Management, Baramati (M.S.) - 413102\nEmail: reshmashinde211@gmail.com\nABSTRACT\nAgrarian economy has numerous players, agents and stakeholder; all seek information for taking rational decisions\nfor their respective roles and objectives. The main objective of Agricultural Market Intelligence is to maintaining a balance\nbetween demand and supply of any agricultural commodity at a remunerative level to farmers. For Increasing Farmers\nparticipation in commercial marketing market intelligence needs to be proper. Keeping this in focus, this paper deals with\nthe current status of Market intelligence, the common objectives and process of market intelligence, the role that government\nplays and should play for improving Market Intelligence. How Market Intelligence is important to the farmers for taking their\nfarming decisions. As for recommendation, the paper drives in the point that Market Intelligence in agriculture and allied\nenterprise should lead in huge sale with better price of agricultural produce. Market Intelligence should helps to better agro-\nprocessing linkages between farmers, groups related to agriculture, markets and private processors which in turn would make\nagriculture a more viable proposition.\nKeywords: market intelligence, objectives, process, importance, govt.

It is important that the farmer should be able to sell his\nor her produce at a convenient stage of the marketing channel.\nFor example, some farmers have the option of selling at farm\ngate, of delivering to a local assembly market, of supplying\na wholesale market direct or of selling directly to retailers\nor even to consumers. Availability of information on market\nconditions at different locations or different points in the\nmarketing chain is necessary for choosing where to market.\nData, Information and Market Intelligence\nData is refers as “raw material” - it needs to be\nprocessed and analyze before it can be turned into something\nuseful. Data comes in many forms - numbers, words, symbols.\nData relates to transactions, events and facts. On its own - it is\nnot very useful. Information is data that has been processed in\nsuch a way as to be meaningful to the person who receives it.\nInformation refers to increased knowledge by understanding\nthe relationships of data. Market Intelligence refers to\norganizing the information to understand implications and\nimpact. That means Market Intelligence differs from data\nand information since it requires some form of analysis.\nMarket Intelligence is the process of collecting relevant\ninformation related to the existing market prices, domestic\nand global agricultural supply and demand conditions, policy\nenvironment and other relevant factors; converting those into\nusable form through scientific modeling and stakeholder’s\nperception and disseminating through effective means so that\ninformed and effective decisions can be taken by the farmers\nand other stakeholders. This process requires that the market\ndata is converted to usable information and then to market\nintelligence. The purpose of this analysis is to derive some\nmeaning from the piles of data and information. By going\nthrough analysis and filtering, one can refine it enough so that\nsomeone can act on it and understand their options, giving\nthem an opportunity to make forward-looking decisions. As\nfar as is possible marketing decisions should be based on sound\ninformation. Thus the process of collecting, interpreting, and\ndisseminating information relevant to marketing decisions\nis known as market intelligence. Market Intelligence should\nnot simply present the facts, declaring what was found; but\ninstead make a statement, saying this is what can be believed\nas about to happen. As Market Intelligence allows one\nto predict or forecast what is going to happen, this in turn\nallows to effectively strategize in relation to the competitive\nenvironment. \tTherefore, \tMI \tindulges \tone \tto \tremain\ncompetitive by improving strategic decisions and this leads\nto better performance against the grain. At the same time, MI\ndoes not attempt to collect and analyze all information for an\nexact picture, but attempts to get enough information to tell\nwhat’s going on. Thus, Accuracy, Availability, Applicability\nand Analysis are the four ‘A’s of market intelligence.\nMarket Intelligence Process\nFig.1 : Market Intelligence Process",

The market intelligence\nunits are intended to help the DESMOA in the formulation,\nimplementation and review of the agricultural price policy\nrelating to procurement, marketing, storage, transportation,\nimport, export and credit, etc. The units furnish regular\nreports on market arrivals, off-takes, stocks, crop prospects,\nand outlook of market prices. They are also required to give\ntheir appraisal of production of various kharif and rabi crops\nat regular intervals to help preparation of crop forecasts.\nAgricultural Market Intelligence is an important and useful\ninstrument, and it should be strengthened and extended to all\nthe States. At present AGMARKNET is the largest network\nin India to provide real time information by connecting major\nregulated markets across the country. AGMARKNET was\nthe mega initiative launched by Government of India through\na network of directorate of Marketing and Inspection,\nDepartment of Agriculture and Cooperation and National\nInformatics Centre. The initiative connected all major\nagricultural markets of the country and provided the current\nprice information to the beneficiaries. The daily information\nis compiled by the regulated markets and provided to NIC for\nsharing on the web portal. Besides the commodity wise price\nand arrival information, the portal has been enriched over a\nperiod of time in terms of providing other useful information\nrelated to Government policies, regulations, subsidies etc.\nBased on the temporal trends, the information is useful for\nthe academic and research organizations for making future\npredictions regarding the price behavior. The Network\nProject on Market Intelligence at NIAP was initiated in 2013\nand sponsored by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research\nto provide reliable and timely price forecasts to farmers for\nselected agricultural commodities in order to enable them to\nmake informed production and marketing decisions, which in\nturn could lead to higher profitability.\nImportance of Agricultural Market Intelligence\nAgricultural marketing can be defined as series\nof services involved in moving a product from the point of\nproduction to the point of consumption. Thus agricultural\nmarketing is a series of inter-connected activities involving:\nplanning production, growing and harvesting, grading,\npacking, transport, storage, distribution and sale. Such\nactivities cannot take place without the exchange of\ninformation. With the transformation of agriculture from\nsubsistence to commercial production systems, farmers\nalso needed more market orientation to succeed in business\nbecause commercial production is basically market - oriented.\nOnly market orientation and market responsiveness could\nfetch better prices under the changed situation. Thus there is\nan increasing awareness that it is not enough to produce a crop\nor commodity; it must be marketed as well. It is necessary\nthat farmer gets the market information about arrivals, prices,\nand quality standards of various commodities, not only from\none market area, but from other market areas in the country\nand if possible from various countries of the world. This will\nenable the farmer to have increased access to the markets and\nrealize better price for his produce. This type of information\nextension made possible by Market Intelligence. Market\nIntelligence helps to farmers to take decisions like what to\ngrow? When to harvest? Where to markets the produce?\nWhether to store it or not? Market Intelligence empowers\nthe farmers and agricultural and allied producers to take\nadvantage of the global opportunities. The information that\nthe trades need are revolve around the returns that they\nreceive from trading of a crop besides selection of market to\nsell. Analogously consumers too want information on what to\nbuy, where to buy and when to buy. The Agriculture Market\nmainly provides the data related to the daily trading, upward\nand downward movements in demands of the agriculture\nproducts. Agricultural market intelligence on agriculture\nand livestock products is extremely essential for enhancing\nproductivity and for facilitating greater volumes of trade in\nthe sector. The Market Intelligence is vital, because such data\nis not only a key input for planning and decision-making\nby agricultural market participants, but also for effective\ngovernment policy making and administrative decision-\nmaking. It helps to forecast prices of different agricultural\nproduce to take a proper decision of production and selling.",

Adding to it\nis the gap in communication between the researcher and the\nfarmer. Developing good market intelligence/ information is\nyet another challenge. Good market intelligence should be\ncomprehensive, accurate, relevant, confidential, trustworthy,\nand equally accessible and timeliness. Agricultural goods are\nquite different from marketing goods. The main difference is\nthey are perishable in nature. Supply is not regular because\nof seasonality in production. Farmers here have small land\nholding which gives scattered production and variability in\nquality of the products. Besides the factor that our is not in a\nposition to reap the benefits of WTO through export, also one\nmajor threat our country is faces is unrealized opportunity in\nagricultural marketing, imports by our country, underexplored\nexport opportunities for Indian products and distortion in\ndomestic market. Another challenge is presence of large\nunorganized markets.\nThe role of Government in Market Intelligence\nThe government plays an important role in the\nmarketing of farm products. The nature and degree of\ninvolvement \tdiffer \tdepending \ton \tthe \tcommodity \tand\nmarketing functions. In general the involvement was greatest\nin the case of grains, particularly, rice and wheat, which were\nstaple products. In some cases, government or state-owned\nenterprises were also directly involved in the marketing of\nspecific industrial/commercial crops such as tea, rubber,\nsugar, oil palm, and coconuts, which were major, export\ncrops of the region. The Government provides much of the\ninfrastructure required for efficient marketing. One of the\nmost important is the information and extension services\nto farmers besides transport & communication facilities,\npublic utility supply, like water, electricity, fiscal and trade\nadministration, public storage, and market facilities. In the\nrecent times the government has focused its attention to\ninvolve \tICT (Information \tCommunication Technology)\ntools to improve the production and thereby the marketing\nprospects of agriculture. The government has become\nkeen on that the ICT should be able to provide answers\nto questions like what and how much to produce, when to\nproduce, in what form to sell, at what price to sell, when\nto sell and where to sell. All these information need to be\nprovided to the farmers and the farming community and\nfarm-business adherents with a ‘press a 9 button’ on the\ncomputer on a continuous updated basis. The government\nhas brought out many online Market Intelligence portals for\nagriculture like: AGMARKNET – www.agmarket.nic.in by\nthe Union Ministry of Agriculture, the e-Vipnan initiative by\nthe Madhya Pradesh State Government, ITC’s e-CHOUPAL,\nDCM SHRIRAM’s Hariyali Kisan Bazar and DEMIC of\nTNAU.\nCONCLUSION\nDevelopment of farmers as well as agriculture sector\nas a whole is become possible by use of market intelligence in\nagriculture. Agricultural Market Intelligence helps in ensuring\nthat produce goes to markets where there is a demand for it.\nIt shortens marketing channels and cuts down on transport\ncosts, and helps ensure that each marketing transaction\nis a fair one, and that all participants share the risks and\nbenefits. Agricultural prices hold tremendous importance\nin Indian economy and have a significant influence on the\ndecision making pattern of farmers and other stakeholders\nregarding crop area and marketing. It is expected that future\nagricultural growth would largely accrue from improvements\nin productivity of diversified farming systems with regional\nspecialization \tand \tsustainable \tmanagement \tof \tnatural\nresources, especially land and water.\nREFERENCES\nAcharya, S.S et al, Agricultural Marketing in India – 4th\neditions, Oxford and IBH Publishing Company,\nNew Delhi, 2010.\nKandpal K, ‘Awareness and Use of Agricultural Market\nIntelligence’.

In other words,\nhealthy soil in northern Indiana is going to be different\nfrom healthy soil in southern Indiana due to the\ninherent nature of the soil. Characteristics like these can\ninfluence the timing and degree of your soil’s response\nto the strategies we describe in more detail below.\nKey Soil Health Components\nWhat does a healthy soil encompass? Here are some of\nthe important players in soil health.\nSoil aggregates are a fundamental concept in soil\nstructure. Aggregates are groups of soil particles that\nbind to each other more strongly than to other particles.\nThey form pores that help soils retain water and air. Soil\naggregates can change quickly. Within a few years of\nstarting conservation practices (such as implementing\nno-till systems and planting cover crops), aggregates can\nchange in size and stability.\nWell-structured soils allow for adequate aeration, water\ninfiltration, and root penetration and growth. Well-\nstructured soils also resist erosion and compaction. We\noften think of aggregates just as one of soil’s physical\nproperties, but biological organisms influence this\nstructure. Earthworms, mycorrhizal fungi, plant roots,\nand organic matter all influence the ways soils form\naggregates.\nWhen earthworms are present in a system, they create\ntunnels. Later, plants can use these tunnels as root\nchannels, allowing roots and water to penetrate deeper\ninto the soil profile. Earthworms also leave behind casts,\nwhich are rich in nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi form\nbeneficial relationships with plants by bringing water\nand nutrients, particularly phosphorus, to a plant in\nexchange for energy in the form of carbon. There are\nmany different “good” soil microorganisms that help\nbreak down residue, recycle nutrients, and combat the\n“bad” pathogenic microorganisms that might negatively\ninfluence your cash crop growth.\nWhat you plant can also influence biological activity\nin your soil. Introducing plant diversity into your\nsystem is a natural way to control weeds and pests,\nincluding pathogenic microorganisms. Diversity can\nincrease nutrient and water use efficiency, introduce\ndifferent root types and residue, and reduce stress on the\ncropping system.\nDiverse root types and residue may reduce your soil’s\nrisk of erosion. Some plants decompose faster than\nothers, so where erosion is a concern, you may want\nto consider introducing a plant that decomposes more\nslowly and keeps the soil covered longer. Soil microbial\ncommunities thrive on diverse residue produced by\nvarious plants. As you add diverse plants, healthier\nsoil for agronomic purposes develops. That’s because\ndifferent plants are able to target a broader range of\nsoil resources than a monoculture system can target.\nMonoculture systems may exhaust certain soil resources\nmore quickly and require additional inputs to maintain.\nOrganic matter plays a big role in soil health. Changes\nin organic matter content do not occur quickly, and it\nmay take several years to see an appreciable difference,\nbut increasing your soil’s organic matter will improve\nits overall health. Organic matter largely contributes\nto a soil’s cation exchange capacity (CEC), and organic\nmatter helps soil hold nutrients and water for plant use.\nSoil microbes decompose residue into organic matter\nand eventually transform it into mineralizable nutrients\nfor plant uptake.\nThe Four Strategies\nThe four strategies for improving your soil’s health are\nnot an all-inclusive list. Rather, these strategies provide\na good base to improve overall soil health. Many of the\nstrategies we discuss are connected and act together to\nimprove soil health.\n1. Practice No-Tillage/Strip-Tillage\nReducing tillage to either no-till or strip-till minimizes\ndisruptions to soil aggregates by not breaking them up\ncontinuously and forcing the system to restart (Figure\n1). Minimal tillage maintains natural aggregates, one\nof the key components of soil health, and helps prevent\nloose soil particles from washing or blowing away easily.\nResidue decomposes more slowly under a reduced\ntillage system for several reasons. One reason is that\nfewer aggregates are broken up with less intensive tillage,\nso less organic matter is exposed to decomposition.\nSecond, reduced tillage can make soil temperatures\nslightly cooler. Lower temperatures help organic\nmatter accumulate, because the residue is not broken\ndown as quickly. Reducing tillage can increase soil\norganism diversity and activity, another one of the key\ncomponents of soil health. Reduced tillage does not\ndisrupt earthworm burrowing and helps protect the\nnetwork created by mycorrhizal fungi that connects\nthem to their host plant. Leaving residue on the soil\nsurface also acts as a barrier against raindrops and wind\nthat could cause erosion.",

Add More Crops to Your Rotation\nCorn-soybean or continuous corn rotations dominate\nthe Midwest landscape. In the short-term, these systems\nyield in abundance and provide good economic returns.\nHowever, a strong strategy for long-term resiliency\nincludes increasing plant diversity in your system.\nAdding winter wheat in your rotation after soybeans\nis a fairly simple way to increase plant diversity, a key\ncomponent of soil health. Wheat’s early harvest also\noffers a longer window of opportunity to establish\ncover crops and add another layer to the crop rotation\n(Figures 2 and 4).\nAnother potential option in some areas is double-\ncropping soybeans after wheat harvest. Whether you\nuse cover crops or another cash crop, keeping the soil\ncovered as long as possible benefits overall soil health.\nPick what fits best in your operation and budget.\n3. Include Cover Crops\nCover crops are becoming more widely adopted, but\nmany farmers still have questions about their usefulness.\nThere is no one-size-fits-all solution to cover crops,\nbut a good place to start finding more information is\nManaging Cover Crops: An Introduction to Integrating\nCover Crops into a Corn-Soybean Rotation (Purdue\nExtension publication AY-353-W), available from the\nEducation Store, edustore.purdue.edu.\nCover crop roots improve soil aggregation and reduce\nerosion. Cover crop residue also reduces the impact of\nraindrops on the soil surface and serves as a habitat and\nfood source for soil microbes. As organisms decompose\nthe residue, nutrients are released back into the soil.\nOrganic matter, a key soil health component, can\nincrease over a longer period as residue is added back\ninto the system. Combining no-till and cover crops\nis a great way to keep your soil covered, minimize\ndisturbance, maximize living root growth, and maximize\nplant diversity.\nCover crops can also help manage nutrients in the field\nby scavenging nitrogen from the soil during typically\nfallow months (Figure 3). In the winter (after you\nremove the cash crop) and in the early spring (before\nplanting) are periods when you usually see the most\nloss of soil nitrogen. Cover crops can prevent some of\nthis loss and recycle nitrogen in the system, eventually\nreleasing the nitrogen from the dead residue as soil\norganisms begin the decomposition process.\nChoosing species that die in the winter (“winter kill”\nspecies such as oats and radish) rather than species that\noverwinter (such as cereal rye and annual ryegrass)\nwill make a difference in the amount of soil nitrogen\nscavenged and the timing of its release.\nFigure 1.

Manage Nutrients\nNutrient management goes hand-in-hand with the first\nthree strategies we discussed. You may need to adjust\nyour fertilizer applications after switching to a reduced\ntillage system, adding a cash crop, or implementing\ncover crops in your rotation.\nAs organic matter increases, you may see an increase\nin your soil’s ability to hold nutrients longer. Keep your\nlocal fertilizer dealer in the loop as you make changes to\nyour system, so they can give you recommendations to\nfit your specific needs.\nGrowing cereal rye before planting corn is not\nrecommended for novice cover crop growers, because\nyou may need to apply more of your nitrogen with the\nplanter to get the corn off to a good start. Over-applying\nfertilizers can reduce mycorrhizal fungi’s natural ability\nto scavenge nutrients for plants and can harm some\nspecies’ abilities to colonize in the future.\nFigure 3.

Crop\nplanning can greatly improve CSA performance by taking\ninto account seasonality, planting schedules, appropriate\ncrops, etc. This fact sheet will help you learn more about\nthe components of an effective crop plan and how to use\none in your CSA operation.\nSeasonality\nSeasonality affects the length of your CSA and the type\nand varieties of fruits and vegetables grown (University\nof California Cooperative Extension, 1995). CSAs\nshould offer fresh, ripe produce at all times (University of\nCalifornia Cooperative Extension, 1995). This will require\nplanning to make sure food is grown at the appropriate\ntime for the right season.\nDue to freezing weather in winter, Utah does not have a\nyear-round growing season (Hunter, Olsen, Drost, Black, &\nGunnell, 2016). The earliest month to begin growing cool\nseason plants in most of Utah is March, with the growing\nseason ending in November. Warm season plants are\ngrown from May to the first frost, usually mid-October\n(Hunter et al., 2016). However, season length varies on\nlocation. Utah has a variety of climates and season length\nis particular to each region. May through November is a\ngeneral range which pertains to most of Utah but this can\nvary depending on your latitude and elevation. The season\ncan be extended through use of greenhouses or hoop\nhouses.\nKnowing when fruits and vegetables can be grown will\nhelp you prepare. You can plan for the most effective\ntime to plant certain crops, map out the season, and\ninform shareholders what they can expect in their shares\nthroughout the CSA season.\nHoop Houses\nHoop houses are a\npossible season extension method available for CSA use.\nPhoto credit: USU Extension\nSeasonality can be extended through the use of alternative\nmeasures. Hoop houses, also known as high tunnels,\nare structures that trap warm air inside the enclosure to\nstimulate plant growth. They are made using an arch-\nshaped frame covered in plastic that is tall enough for\na person to either drive a tractor through or stand up in\n(Bachmann, 2005). According to Utah State University\nExtension (2016), hoop houses “significantly increase\nearliness, total yield potential, and crop quality” (p. 7).\nHoop houses can provide protection against storms,\nincreased pest management, decreased occurrence of\nplant diseases, and an extended season length (Upson,\n2014).\nYou should consider several factors when building a\nhoop house. Location and site placement are important.\nHoop houses should be oriented with the ends toward the\ndominant wind direction (Utah State University Extension,\n2016). Sites should have maximum sun exposure in\norder to heat the inside of the structure (Upson, 2014).\nSnow should be brushed off the top to prevent cold\nwater leakage and sun blocking (Utah State University\nExtension, 2016). Ventilation is key to adjusting inside\ntemperatures, especially when outside temperatures are\nhot (Penn State Extension, 2003). If the inside of the hoop\nhouse gets too hot, extreme changes in humidity, plant\ndiseases, and significant damage to crop production may\noccur (Utah State University Extension, 2016).\nCrop Planning\nSample Crop Plan\n(Hunter et al., 2016)\nCSAs often offer a large diversity of products and produce.\nDue to the nature of CSAs, crop planning “becomes\nan essential planning tool for creating and maintaining\nefficiency and timeliness of cropping in order to meet\nharvest goals” (Center for Agroecology and Sustainable\nFood Systems, n.d., p. 3).\nWhat is a Crop Plan?\nA crop plan assists you in planning, organizing, planting,\nharvesting, and recording for crop production. The\nplan, usually created during the winter when harvest\nwork is low, provides direction and planning for the\nplanting, maintaining, harvesting, and organizing of crops\nthroughout the entire growing season.\nCrop plans can also help improve time management and\nexecution of the growing season (Penn State Extension,\n2013). You must maintain several different varieties\nof crops, many of which need succession plantings",

    "content": "Community Supported Agriculture: Crop Planning 2\n(Good & Good, 2012; Volk, 2011). A crop plan can help\norganize what can be planted based on the amount of land\navailable, mapping out the harvest, and ensuring effective\nland management (Volk, 2011).\nPlanning helps minimize potential complications further\nin the growing season and makes the CSA management\nprocess run smoother (Good & Good, 2012; Penn State\nExtension, 2013). Crop planning also improves data\ncollection, which allows you to evaluate success at the\nend of the season (Penn State Extension, 2013). Small\nFarm Central (2007) provides an example of a simple crop\nplan that can be used as a reference, available at http://\nwww.smallfarmcentral.com/.\nHow to use a Crop Plan\nA crop plan can be specifically adjusted to fit your needs\nand preferred style. A lot of crop planning has moved to\nan electronic format through spreadsheets and software\nprograms that localize all planning and recording to one\nlocation. Spreadsheets are “easy to edit, easy to store,\nand easy to sort and to make automatic calculations\non” (Volk, 2011). There are many services and programs\nyou can purchase to record and monitor data. However,\nthere are also free options.\nAccording to Small Farm Central (2007) and the Center\nfor Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (n.d.), this\nplan should include at least the following information:\n• Weekly and seasonal harvest goals\n• Planting date\n• Planting information (greenhouse, direct sow, etc.)\n• Amount\n• Crop\n• Yield/unit (lbs, pint, head, etc.)\n• Rows (amount and distance between each)\n• Extra details (how deep/far apart to plant seeds,\ngeneral crop information, etc.\nYou should update this plan regularly, taking into account\nthe performance of previous seasons and making\nnecessary amendments for the upcoming season (Good\n& Good, 2012). You can review crops that did not work\nwell, try new crops to include in shares, and plant more of\npopular produce. When used effectively, a crop plan can\nbecome a major asset and a tool you can use to get the\nmost out of your CSA operation.\nWeekly and Seasonal Harvest Goals\nTo begin crop planning, you must first determine whatfruits\nand vegetables to include and how much of each crop to\ninclude in a single share each week of the season (Center\nfor Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, n.d.).\nThis provides a base for crop planning for the season. You\nneed to decide whether or not to offer certain fruits and\nvegetables each week, certain weeks only, or not at all.\nFor example, if you decide to include two heads of lettuce\nin a full share, and there are 50 full shares, then there is\na need for 100 heads of lettuce total. However, a 20-25%\nbuffer window should be established around the amount\nof lettuce to protect against crop losses or undistributable\nproduce, so 120 to 125 plants per week should be ready\nfor harvest (Hitt, n.d.). If there are 5 months in a season, or\n22 weeks total, then 2,640 to 2,750 lettuce plants should\nbe planted to ensure CSA success.\nNumber of Plants Per Planting\nAfter determining what type and amount of produce\nto distribute, you must determine when and how often\nto plant. According to the Center for Agroecology and\nSustainable Food Systems (n.d.), mature lettuce “in a\ncool, coastal climate will retain its quality in the ground\nfor 14 days.” This means one planting can reap a 2\nweeks’ harvest. This allows lettuce to be planted biweekly\nthroughout the season. If you plan to harvest 100 heads\nof lettuce each week, you can plant double the amount\neach week. This equals 200 seeds per planting. Again,\ninclude a 25% buffer window for poor germination or other\ndifficulties. With the buffer, you would need up to 250 total\nseeds for planting.\nNumber of Plants Per Planting\nOnce the frequency of plantings has been determined,\nyou can identify the total number of plantings required per\nseason. You must calculate the total length of the season\nand the total length of time between plantings.\nFor example, if a CSA operates for 5 months out of the\nyear, and produce requires three plantings per month, the\ntotal number of plantings required per season would be 15\n(Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems,\nn.d.). After determining the amount of plantings and the\nlength of time between each, you can determine specific\nplanting dates throughout the season to effectively achieve\nthe overall harvest goals (Matthewson, n.d.). According\nto Matthewson (n.d.), having a planting schedule can\nhelp CSA operators perform a variety of tasks such as\ndocumenting and managing information vital to crop\nproduction. It can also be used to record information for\nlater seasons, such as crop performance and the quantity\nand quality of the harvest.",

    "content": "Audience \tand \tObjectivesAdaptable except where noted.\nOBJECTIVES: \tAt the end of this module, growers will be able to:\n• Choose varieties, quantities and succession dates for all crops.\n• Adapt their own planting plans, calendars, seed orders, and variety selection.\n• Conduct basic calculations to determine the number of seeds needed using\naddition and simple division.\nWHO: \tRefugee farmers and growers\n• This is a good launching point for new farmers with some growing experience\n(including in home country), who are unfamiliar with crop production planning\nor marketing in the U.S.\n• New farmers aiming to participate in a CSA are encouraged to use this tool.\nTEACHING TIP: This is a crop planning for CSA toolkit and does not include planning for\nmarket and wholesale. However, the principles of this tool can be used to plan\nmore generally, and do not need to be used exclusively for CSA.\nLANGUAGE / LITERACY \tEmerging to developing language / mixed literacy\n• Language can be adapted to beginning levels if an interpreter is present at\nall sessions. Support staff can help pre-literate farmers fill out planning sheets.\nNon-literate farmers may need help in the beginning but can learn quickly.\nDEVELOPER’S NOTE: We teach this guide to a group of 4-6 advanced farmers, two of which are\nlow-literate. Have one staff member teach and another staff member assist\nthe two low-literate farmers with filling in the crop production plan. It works\nwell for the low-literate farmers to be mixed in with higher literacy farmers so\nthat they can help each other out. If farmers can read, write and understand\nnumbers, this tool can be used.\nBecause of the literacy level of the farmers in our program, we would do one-\non-one sessions with our farmers to use these tools. However, farmers can\nlearn quite well from each other if they are at different literacy levels so there\nis always the opportunity to use small groups.\nFARMING EXPERIENCE: \tAt least 1 year experience farming in U.S.\nWhen broken down adequately, concepts can be understood and used by a\nfirst-year farmer.\nCROP PLANNING / PAGE 5 OF 15",

The number of plants (column A of crop\nplan) and unit of measure (CSA boxes column B) could be edited as needed.\nSEASON: \tPre-Season or Mid-Season (not adaptable)\nCompleting module pre-season ensures farmers have time to get seeds before\nthe season starts. Farmers will want to plan for fall during Mid-July to Mid-\nAugust.\nADAPTATIONS: \tFeedback from reviewers and testers\nIt is challenging to adapt this planning kit to a different model of selling\n(aggregate CSA). For example, the seed calculator and parts of the crop\nproduction plan might be useful with considerable changes to the calendar\nfor your region or changes to other tools to match your system. For different\nsystems, it could be more feasible to use this guide in smaller groups or one-on-\none to adapt the concepts and make it more useful to participants.",

    "content": "CROP PLANNING / PAGE 8 OF 15\nDeveloper’s Notes:\nUsing the Crop Planning Tool\nCOLUMNS IN CROP PLANNING TOOL\nColumn A: \tCrop production plans are divided into two sizes for farmers doing 1-9 CSA\nboxes and farmers doing 10-20 boxes. The numbers in Column A (number of\nplants per CSA box) have a built-in buffer because usually we lose some crops to\npests, disease, etc. If that buffer is 1.5 plants per CSA box and a farmer is doing\n20 CSAs then that buffer becomes 30 extra plants (20 x 1.5) which is likely too\nmuch space and will not get sold. But, if a farmer is only doing 6 CSAs, then the\nbuffer is 9 extra plants (6 x 1.5) which is more appropriate. Given this, the buffer\nfor 10-20 CSA boxes is less. To increase accuracy, you could divide the guides\nup into more size categories. E.g., for 1-5 boxes, 6-10, 11-15, etc. However, it\nis difficult to have even two guides because if you make a change to one you\nmust make it to all of them. It is not crucial that farmers understand the buffer\nconcept to use the tool. Only advanced farmers might want to understand it\nenough to alter the number in column A.\nColumn B: \tHere farmers will fill in how many CSA boxes they are growing for. Begin by\nexplaining this to farmers and have them fill in their number all the way through\nevery page in the crop production plan.\nColumn C: \tColumn C is where farmers must get out their calculators. We begin with a short\nlesson on how to use a calculator, and have a calculator projected on power\npoint slide so facilitator can point to the relevant symbols. Column C gives the\ntotal number of seeds or plants they need to plant for that crop succession.\nThey multiply Column A by Column B and enter the number into Column C.\nIf farmers are struggling with this concept or if there is a time crunch, you\ncan stop once they have completed Column C and be finished with the tool.\nAdvanced or more educated farmers may finish Column C quickly and it can be\nhelpful to have a staff member ready to teach them Column F, even if the rest\nof the group is still on Column C.\nColumn D: \tThis tells the farmer how far apart to plant the crop.\nColumn E: \tThis tells the farmer how many rows per bed to plant the crop.\nColumn F: \tColumn F will tell a farmer how many bed feet this crop will take up. This is\nuseful for planning and bed prep. They must do a lengthier calculator entry\nbut the math is simple. Have them fill out Column C before going on to Column\nF so they can repeat the same calculation, instead of switching between two\ndifferent equations for Columns C and F.",

It\ntakes reminding to get farmers to do this but is very useful when they ask us\nquestions later on. It makes this a very rudimentary record keeping tool.\n÷ Column: \tHere farmers will fill in the varieties they are planting, referencing the calendar\nto know which varieties to plant. They need to divide the number in Column C\nby the number of boxes (or the number next to the division symbol).\n• It is best to divide this column into two steps:\n• Step one: Farmers do the division and write the resulting number in the\ntop of the box. Complete this first before writing in the variety name.\n• Step two: Consult the planting calendar and write the variety name\nby succession. They can look at the planting calendar and find (for\nexample) Tomato 2 and fill in the 8 varieties. See the filled-out farmer\ncrop production plan for reference.\nPLANTING CALENDAR\nThe planting calendar is organized by first stating the vegetable name, the\nplanting succession, and then the variety.\nFor example, Turnip 1 Hakurei tells us that this is our first planting of turnips\nand we will be planting the Hakurei variety.\nThis organization is important so it can be transferred in an organized way to\nthe crop production plan. Consistency is key across these three tools.\n\n-- 9 of 15 --",

Look at their seed\ncalculator tool, note how many grams of each seed they bought and charge\nthem accordingly. There is a tab on the seed calculator tool that includes\nseeds per ounce and pound (in addition to gram) as well as cost per gram for\ncalculating cost. The cost will vary with different seed companies.\nSTEP 2: \tINTRODUCTION TO SEED CALCULATOR TOOL\na. \tWhen filling out the Seed Calculator Tool, have farmers identify which crops in\ntheir plans will be direct seeded.\n• This is a place for error. Have farmers go through their crop production plan\nand circle where they see the word SEEDS. (SEEDS is orange in color which\nmay help them identify the word.)\nb. \tNext, take the total number of seeds from column C of the Crop Production\nPlan and fill it into column C of the Seed Calculator Tool.\nc. \tThis step is the most challenging. Have farmers look at their crop production\nplan and put a number in column F for each time they plant of that crop. These\nnumbers represent successions and will indicate the number of bags of seeds\nthey will end up weighing out for that crop.\n• When farmers fill in column F of the seed calculator tool they often are\nfilling in for several succession plantings. First, have them count how many\nsuccessions of a crop they are doing (e.g., 4 successions of radishes). They\ncan see this in their crop production plan. They then write in 1, 2, 3, and 4 in\ncolumn F and CIRCLE those numbers to ensure they are not confused with\nthe number of grams they are about to write next to that circled number.\nTEACHING TIP: The number of seeds in the Crop Production Plan in column C sometimes\nchanges based on the succession. For example, we have two farmers who\ndo farmers market and CSA. Because the farmers market starts before the\nCSA, their first plantings are smaller. Once the CSA starts (later succession\nplantings) they will need to plant more to accommodate CSA and market, so\nlater successions are larger plantings.\nd. \tHave farmers do the math (column C divided by column D) and fill it in for each\ntime in column F.\nTEACHING TIP: Be sure to check farmers’ crop production plans BEFORE they weigh out seeds\nto avoid math mistakes. If you catch a mistake in their crop production plan\nlater on, double check their math on the seed calculator tool and have them\nre-weigh their seeds.\ne. \tAt this point, show farmers visually what the information in column D means by\nweighing out a gram of beans (usually 4 seeds) and then something small, like\nArugula (456 seeds). Explain that this number tells us how many seeds are in a\ngram. Depending on farmers’ levels of comprehension, this might take several\ndemonstrations using different examples to communicate the basic idea.\n•\n•\n•\n•\nABC",

CABI’s PestSmart Diagnostic Field Guide supports diagnostic decisions by\nshowing relationships between common symptoms on plants and the various possible causes.\nThis document provides images and descriptions of many typical symptoms associated with biotic\nand abiotic factors that harm plant health. Among the biotic factors, the major pest groups are\nrepresented. Throughout the Field Guide, the term ‘pests’ will refer to all animals, microorganisms\nand weeds that damage plants. The most common abiotic factors of plant health decline are also\nhighlighted. This book does not attempt to show all possible plant/disorder combinations; therefore,\nit is important to understand the different types of symptoms caused by each factor and to use that\nknowledge to make a field diagnosis.\nThe Field Guide consists of ‘ready reckoners’ (simple information tables for quick and easy\nreference) that serve as reminders of symptom–cause associations and therefore can assist in\ndiagnosing plant health problems. Many biotic and abiotic factors create very similar symptoms\nin plants, therefore a table is provided (Potential sources of confusion) that identifies these\nareas of overlap and provides methods to differentiate between the possible causes.\nThe Field Guide concludes with a short section on important points to remember when\nselecting management options for crop problems following an integrated pest management\napproach.",

    "content": "Field Diagnosis: A Process of Elimination\t8\nFIELD DIAGNOSIS: A PROCESS OF\nELIMINATION\nThe process of diagnosing a plant health problem without any specialised laboratory equipment\nis called ‘field diagnosis’. Field diagnosis involves careful observation of the symptoms on a\nplant and linking those symptoms with possible causes. While some plant health problems are\nrelatively easy to diagnose, others can be very difficult for a number of reasons. For instance,\nthere may be multiple factors that cause similar symptoms, or the plant being examined may not\nshow very clear symptoms. As a result, it will often not be possible to make a highly specific field\ndiagnosis, such as giving the name of a nutrient that is deficient or the pest species causing the\nproblem. However, in many cases a very specific diagnosis is not necessary to identify corrective\nmeasures. A diagnosis of a pest group, such as fungus or stem-boring insect, will provide a lot\nof useful information for developing an adequate solution. The precision and accuracy of the\ndiagnosis ultimately depends on one’s knowledge of the plants and the known problems in the\narea, with additional support from tools like the PestSmart Diagnostic Field Guide.\nPrecise versus accurate\nThese two terms are often used interchangeably but they are different.\nA precise diagnosis is very specific, perhaps naming a pest species\n(as opposed to a pest group like virus or mite). An accurate diagnosis\nis one that is correct.\nIf someone claimed she weighed 62.64932 kg, that would be very\nprecise but hopelessly inaccurate if she actually weighed 67.5 kg. It\nis sometimes better to settle for lower precision (specificity) to ensure\nhigher accuracy. In this example about body weight, it would have\nbeen far better for the person to have said she weighed about 65 kg.\nA field diagnosis of Fusarium oxysporum race 4 would be very precise\nbut very inaccurate if the cause was nematode attack. Do not try to be\nprecise unless you can be sure you are also accurate (correct).\nThe first step in narrowing down the cause of a plant health problem is to determine if the\nsymptoms are caused by a living organism (biotic) or by a non-living factor (abiotic).\nAbiotic factors usually affect the whole plant and often (but not always) there is not a defined line\nbetween healthy and affected tissue, although exceptions will be discussed later in the section on\npotential sources of confusion (Table 6). Many abiotic causes of poor plant health are associated\nwith the soil environment (compaction, pH, nutritional deficiencies, etc.). These tend to affect all\nof the upper parts of the plant since they are all connected to the same root system. Other abiotic\nfactors, such as heat, wind, cold, hail, etc. have direct effects on the above-ground parts of the\nplant and lead to symptoms that are often distributed symmetrically within the plant and within\nindividual leaves.",

    "content": "Field Diagnosis: A Process of Elimination\t9\nThe huge variety of pests that attack crops gives rise to a great variety of symptoms. Where the\npest is active there may be a clear line between the healthy and the affected tissue, with more\ngeneral symptoms of stress elsewhere on the plant. Much of the remainder of this field guide\nprovides information on how to link symptoms with cause.\nOnce the cause of the crop problem has been narrowed down to either a biotic or abiotic factor,\nit will usually be possible to take the diagnosis to the next level of detail. For biotic causes this\nwould mean identifying the pest group (virus, mite, etc.), and for abiotic causes this would mean\ndetermining whether the problem is associated with water, nutrients, temperature or some other\nenvironmental factor. It may be possible to take the diagnosis even further, such as naming a\nspecific nutrient that is deficient or naming the virus, or mite, or even giving a species name.\nThe more precise a diagnosis is, the better it is because it means that a more specific and\neffective recommendation can be given. However, making a very precise diagnosis is more\ndifficult (for instance, many pest species look very similar) and the risk of making a mistake is\nhigher compared to making a general diagnosis. Whenever you are unable to provide a full\ndiagnosis to the pest species level or of the specific abiotic factor, make as precise a diagnosis\nas you can with confidence. As a diagnosis, ‘insect’ is useful but not particularly informative.\n‘Maize stem borer’ is more helpful and ‘Lepidoptera maize stem borer’ is better still; however,\navoid going further unless you know which stem borer it is because, depending on where you\nwork, it could be one of several species that are difficult to distinguish.\nDon’t be in too much of a hurry. Slow down, cut open the plant and have a look inside. Use a hand\nlens to look for fungal fruiting bodies or small insects. Remember to ALWAYS eliminate all the\nalternative causes before pronouncing your final diagnosis.\nIn many cases, a single plant sample and information may not be enough to make a diagnosis,\nin which case a visit to the production site or garden may be required.",

    "content": "Field Diagnosis: A Process of Elimination\t10\nExample: Field diagnosis of spots on leaves\nThis cashew leaf has leaf spots, which are clearly defined and are all a similar size.\nThis clear delineation between healthy (green) and unhealthy (tan brown) tissue indicates that there is a biotic cause. If\nthe cause were an abiotic one you would expect to see a much more general yellowing or browning of the leaf without\nthe sharp divide between healthy and unhealthy plant material.\nWe can eliminate certain biotic causes through a mixture of experience and observation because the symptoms they\ngenerally produce do not fit in with the evidence presented.\n• This symptom is not caused by insect or mite damage; there is no evidence of chewing, no webbing seen and no\npresence of insects or mites.\n• This symptom is not caused by a nematode, virus or phytoplasma, as these organisms do not cause leaf spots.\n• This symptom is not caused by a mammal or parasitic plants or weeds, as there is no evidence of it having been\neaten (mammal) or of decline caused by competition by weeds or parasitisation by another plant.\n• This symptom could be caused by a bacterial pathogen but you would expect the spots to have a water-soaked\nmargin, to be bound between the leaf veins and generally associated with the edge of the leaf.\n• This symptom could be caused by a water mould but the leaf spots are not spreading aggressively (they are all of a\nsimilar size), have a clearly defined border and show no evidence of fluffy sporulation. All of these characteristics\ntogether indicate that a water mould is not the causal agent.\nBy the process of elimination it can be concluded that this symptom has a fungal cause. They are known to cause\nleaf spots with these characteristics. More detailed examination of the material with a hand lens reveals fungal fruiting\nbodies (arrowed), making this diagnosis definitive.\nRobert Reeder, CABI",

It may be necessary to visit the field to see fresh\nsymptoms and to gain other information on the problem. If you intend to send a sample to\nanother colleague or a formal diagnostic support service, it is usually a good idea to visit the\nfield yourself and to select a fresh sample of your own.\nThe following is a summary of what to do when visiting a field to observe the symptoms in the\ncontext of the entire crop. (All of the information gathered would be of interest to a diagnostic\nsupport service if a sample were to be sent.)\nSTEP 1: GET IN CLOSE\n• What parts are affected?\n• Describe symptoms using the correct terminology.\n• Observe changes in shape, colour and growth.\n• Look for visible signs of insects, fungi or other pests.\nSTEP 2: LOOK AT THE WHOLE PLANT (INCLUDING ROOTS)\n• Where are the symptoms within the plant?\n• Which growth stages are affected?\n• How do the symptoms progress from early to late stages?\n• How severe is the attack?\nSTEP 3: EXAMINE GROUPS OF PLANTS\n• Incidence: how many plants are affected?\n• Distribution: random, edge of the plot only, in patches, pattern caused by use\nof machinery?\n• Remember: consider plant variety, age and how it is grown.\nSTEP 4: SPEAK TO FARMERS AND OTHER LOCAL EXTENSION WORKERS\n• When did the problem appear? Is this the first time?\n• Record local name for the problem.\n• Consider soil type and climate (patterns).\n• Obtain information on the varieties used, recent history of chemical inputs used, etc.",

In order to use the ready reckoners effectively, some experience of diagnosing\nplant health problems is required by the observer. There is one table for insect and mite pests\nand one for pathogens, and the latter is then expanded to deal with each symptom group in\nmore detail.\nInsect and mite pests\nThe body shape and general appearance are often sufficient to identify many insects and mites\n(Tables 1 and 2) to a group level, so no additional text is supplied in this PestSmart Diagnostic\nField Guide.\nPlant pathogen pests\nAs microorganisms are generally not visible, diagnosis is primarily based on symptoms (Table 3)\nhowever additional information is provided in the remainder of this PestSmart Diagnostic Field Guide.\nMineral deficiencies\nThis ready reckoner (Table 4) summarises the major symptoms that many plants show when short\n(deficient) of a mineral. It provides only general information and shortage of a mineral is just one\nof many causes that can produce some of these symptoms. Not all crop plants display the same\nsymptoms even when deficient in the same mineral (especially true for zinc). Some plants are\nmore susceptible to shortage of minerals than others (e.g. molybdenum shortage in brassicas).\nPhotographs of mineral deficient plants are provided in Table 5.\nIt is unlikely that the mineral deficiency will be so acute that the seedlings die (the seed carries\nlimited amounts of mineral). In most cases the shortage is chronic and the plants will survive\nbut show symptoms that can be severe or mild. Chronic symptoms generally include slow\ngrowth (possibly stunting) and poor flowering and fruit production (where relevant). Yields\ncan be affected even when symptoms are not seen. The more commonly deficient minerals\nare listed on the left of the table and the less commonly deficient ones on the right. While field\nsymptoms may be sufficient to provide an accurate diagnosis by an experienced person who\nis familiar with local soil conditions, it is usually essential to have the field diagnosis confirmed\nwith a laboratory soil analysis. This is especially important if someone is intending to spend a\nsignificant amount of money or effort on correcting the problem.",

In the sections below we take the symptoms from Table 3, and treat each\nin turn, providing additional information on the symptoms and their causative agents.\nWilt\nWilt is a very common symptom of plants in distress. Plants rely on the water in leaves and\nstems to hold them up; without the water the plants will wilt, i.e. the green parts of the plant\nwill hang down limply. Unless water is restored to a wilted plant it will die. The roots or stems\nor base of the stem may be the affected area of the plant although the symptom will mostly be\nseen in the leaves. Sometimes it can be just one region of the plant that is affected (indicating a\nproblem in the stem) but more usually the whole plant will wilt. Wilts can be temporary whereby\nthe plant will recover at night but wilt again the next day, this can be normal if the sun is strong\nand the ground dry but it may also indicate a problem.\nSYMPTOM \tFUNGUS\nWilt \tYES Very common. Usually Fusarium or Verticillium sp.\nInternal staining is commonly associated with fungal pathogens\nthat cause wilts. In this cinchona stem the staining is apparent\nonce the outer bark has been removed.\nFusarium oxysporum f.sp. cucumerinum on cucumber. Leaves are\nseverely short of water. The leaves will soon turn yellow and then\nbrown as the plant cannot survive in such conditions.\nJulien Lamontagne-Godwin \tCABI\nFungi commonly produce wilts in plants by preventing water from flowing up the tubes (xylem) in the stems, resulting in\nthe leaves becoming starved of water. Wilt-inducing fungi are mostly soil borne pathogens and they attack the roots and the\nbase of the stem. There is often discolouration of the xylem. The main fungal groups that produce wilts are Fusarium and\nVerticillium. Whereas Fusarium can produce a pink colouration inside the stem, Verticillium produces dark streaks. Cut the\nstem open and look for discolouration, making sure you compare it to a healthy plant.",

Once a leaf is damaged\na mark of some sort will always remain, not all of these marks are considered leaf spots. A true\nleaf spot is the site of an infection by a pathogen. It will start small and enlarge with time. It is\nan extemely common symptom and experience is required to identify the cause. In this section\nother spots on leaves are included as leaf spots.\nSYMPTOM \tFUNGUS\nLeaf spot \tYES Very common, many types involved on a wide range of\ncrops. Rust pustules are included as leaf spots here.\nLeaf spots of Venturia inaequalis on apple in Nepal.\nYubak Dhoj, Department of Agriculture, Nepal\nThe leaf spot is a classic symptom of many groups of fungi. The leaf is generally unaffected except for the area of the leaf spot and\nimmediate surrounding area. The margins of the leaf spot may be a different colour to the inside. Bacteria and water moulds (see\nbelow) can produce similar symptoms. Leaf spots on grasses often turn into streaks because of the geometry of the leaf, i.e. the leaf\nveins direct the pathogen along the length of the leaf. Fungal lesions will spread but will generally not consume the whole leaf. They\nappear to reach a certain size and then stop growing; this is not the case for some foliar pathogens, especially Phytophthora (a water\nmould) and bacteria, which can spread aggressively across the whole leaf. An indication that the leaf spots are caused by a true\nfungus is that they are all of similar size (or go on to grow to a similar size) and the older ones may have fungal fruiting bodies within\nthem (see below). Visible fruiting bodies are not produced by bacteria or water moulds (although water moulds may produce fluffy\nspores). The fungal fruiting bodies are not always present (even in fungal infections) and are difficult to see with the naked eye but are\noften visible with a hand lens.\nCorrect use of a hand lens will enable you to see great detail within a leaf spot (as well as mites and other small pests). Hold the lens\nclose to the eye and move the plant material back and forth until it is in focus (left). The same technique can be used to increase the\nmagnification of a compact camera (right). All the photographs in this section were taken using this technique.\nPhil Taylor, CABI",

As the bacterial numbers increase you will see the spots spread across the\nleaf. Bacterial leaf spots are more likely to be limited by the leaf veins in the initial stages but when the infection is growing rapidly,\nthe expanding numbers of bacteria will push the infection past leaf veins. The edges of a bacterial leaf spot are often water-soaked,\nthe plant tissue leaks material and the bacterial gums fill up the air spaces that are usually within the leaf. You will never see\nstructures within a bacterial leaf spot as bacteria do not produce fruiting bodies which are characteristic of fungi.

This distinguishes it from ‘yellowing’ where the yellowed area of the\nleaf is continuous. The mosaic caused by viruses is often associated with rugosity (this is where the leaf does not lie flat\nbetween the veins).\n\n-- 37 of 104 --",

Plants can go into decline, where yellowing\nand reduced growth leads to further reduction in growth and so the problem continues.

Dig up the plant and look for galls or cysts on the roots; if these are found it is definitely a nematode cause.\nNematodes that do not produce galls or cysts cause blackening and decay of the roots. The pattern of\n\tnematode attack in the field will often be patchy and not uniform.\n2. Yellowing.\n This is a classic symptom of\nnitrogen (N) or sulphur (S) deficiency.\n2. Add fertiliser to overcome any potential shortage in the soil. Look for galls, cysts or blackened roots, all of\nwhich are signs of nematodes.\n35\n\tNEMATODES/PHYSICAL\n\t& HERBICIDE\n1.

Enquire about the use of soil acting residual herbicides.\n36\n\tINSECTS/MITES\n1. Leaf silvering\n and\n bronzing.\n Mites and small\nleaf-feeding insects both produce silvering and\n\tbronzing symptoms on leaves and fruit.\nConfusion possible\t\n1. Look for the causative agents and for webbing associated with mites. Moth and butterfly larvae (caterpillars)\nalso produce webbing, however they usually leave visible frass behind.\n2.

Look for the causal agent or evidence of its feeding\nusing a hand lens.\n3. Galls.\n Outgrowths on leaves and stems are\ncommonly associated with both groups of\n\tpests.\n3. Insect-induced galls usually contain immature insect(s) within a hollow chamber in the gall. Galls of mites\nare usually small, containing very small hair-like structures amongst which the mites live, but the mites are\n\tusually too small to be seen.\n37\n\tINSECTS/MAMMALS\n\t& BIRDS\n1.

Each of these options\n(including doing nothing) will have consequences, implications and costs for the farmer. When\nmaking a recommendation to intervene (or not), the following ‘Big 5’ features of the advice\nshould be considered.\nWhen making a recommendation, advisors have to ask themselves if the advice they are\nproviding has all of the following characteristics. If the guidance does not meet all of these\ncriteria, the advice is either of no use to the farmer or is poor advice.\nA recommendation must be:\n1. Economic\n2. Effective\n3. Safe\n4. Practical\n5. Locally available\nBIG 5 – Economic\nGenerally the control measures that you recommend to farmers must pay for themselves, i.e. the\nincrease in yield and/or quality is worth more than the labour and input you suggest. It is important\nto remember, and to remind farmers, that the presence of a pest does not necessarily require pest\nmanagement action. Farmers should monitor their problems closely and only invest money or\nlabour when the pest poses a significant threat to crop quality or yield.\nIn some cases, the best advice for farmers is actually to ‘do nothing’. This should be the case if\nthe problem is only minor and will not have an important impact on the crop (that is, the farmer\nmight actually lose money overall by investing in control measures). A second scenario that may\narise is where the affected crop is soon to be harvested. For some kinds of problems, harvesting\nthe crop may protect it from further damage. Furthermore, if a pesticide is recommended, farmers\nshould be very cautious about applying the product to their crops shortly before the harvest,\nespecially if it is food for immediate consumption. Finally, farmers might be advised not to invest\nin controlling a current pest problem if the crop is so heavily damaged that any attempt to save\nthe crop will fail. In that case, the best advice may be to harvest what is available and to use\npreventive measures to avoid having the same problem during the next cropping season.\nThere can be occasions when it is not economic to control a pest on that particular crop but\nnevertheless it is good agricultural practice to do so, to protect human health from fungal\ncontaminants of crops, prevent the spread of a pest vectoring disease, reduce future re-",

Good agricultural practice is all\nabout making sure that the environment is respected while maintaining good yields in the long\nterm.\nBIG 5 – Effective\nAny recommendation made to farmers must be effective. Extension workers should only\nmake recommendations that have either been scientifically validated, for example by national\nagricultural research stations; or that are based on commercially available products which have\ngone through all necessary registration and testing; or that are based on locally tried and tested\nfarmer practices that have stood the test of time and that extension workers have witnessed\nand seen beneficial results for themselves.\nBIG 5 – Safe\nMany crop protection products can be poisonous to humans and safety is an important\nconcern. Farmers often take risks with pesticides. Extension staff should discourage unsafe\npractices and encourage farmers to wear appropriate, clean and relevant protection (and not\nthen change their behaviour and take greater risks because they are wearing it).\nWhile it is under the control of the sovereign government of any country to decide which\npesticides can and cannot be used in agricultural production, broadly the same pesticides\nare banned or restricted in many countries because of international agreements that most\ncountries have signed. There are, however, minor, but significant, local differences in pesticide\nuse. Through its Plantwise programme, CABI promotes compliance with specific international\nconventions/protocols and has a policy of discouraging the use of potentially dangerous\npesticides that are named in those agreements. The complete list of pesticides banned or\nrestricted by the international conventions is provided in the Plantwise Pesticide Red List (Annex\n3). This list is constantly being revised, so please obtain regular updates from the Plantwise\nknowledge bank website.\nThere are two kinds of poisoning: acute and chronic. Acute poisoning occurs when an\nindividual is exposed to a large single dose of pesticide, such as if a child were to drink some\nconcentrate. You may see immediate and drastic symptoms, or it may take up to 24 hours for\nthe symptoms to appear. The kind of symptoms associated with organophosphate pesticide\npoisoning are provided in Table 7 below. If pesticides have been swallowed, wash the victim’s\nmouth with lots of water. The pesticide label should tell you whether or not the victim should\ndrink water to dilute the chemicals, so read the label carefully. Always seek medical advice.",

This is most common among farmers who use pesticides\nregularly. Symptoms can include nervousness, slowed reflexes, irritability and an overall\ndecrease in health, as well as arthritis.\nBIG 5 – Practical\nThe practicality of the recommendation should be considered when providing advice. There are\nplenty of effective and safe methods of control which are entirely impractical for many farmers.\nThis may be because they are too time consuming or require the use of specialist equipment.\nFor example, hand picking caterpillars from a field of kale could be effective but would be totally\nimpractical except for a very small area.\nBIG 5 – Locally available\nIf a product is not available to the farmers then there is little point in making the\nrecommendation.

The following tables provide very general advice as to the biology of\nvarious pests.\nThe way in which the pest survives in the absence of a susceptible crop plant has great\nimplications in the control of pests.\nTable 8. The means by which various pests survive in the absence of crop plants\nPEST \tRESTING STAGE \tNOTES\nFungi \tYes (spores) \tFungi often produce two types of spore: one for survival during\ndormant periods and one for rapid spread under favourable\nconditions. Necrotrophic fungi and bacteria can survive and continue\nto grow on crop debris (the biotrophic fungi such as rusts, powdery\nmildews and smuts cannot do this).\nWater moulds \tYes (spores) \tAs above; biotrophic water moulds include downy mildews.\nNecrotrophic ones include Phytophthora spp.\nBacteria \tNo \tPlant pathogenic bacteria do not produce spores. They survive in\ncrop debris or in the soil.\nNematodes \tYes (cysts, eggs) \tAdult nematodes cannot survive for long outside the host but cysts\nand eggs can survive desiccation for many years.\nInsects \tYes \tThere is no dormant stage equivalent to a seed, but most insect\nspecies have stages (usually egg or pupa) that will survive for\nmonths of adverse conditions without feeding.\nMites \tYes \tSome mites can pass periods of adverse conditions without food as\neggs or adults. This is particularly true in temperate regions, but also\noccurs during the dry season.\nViruses \tNo \tPlant viruses generally cannot survive outside the host plant or vector\n(i.e. the insect which transmits the virus). They survive in volunteer\ncrop plants, or alternative host plants including some weeds when\nthere is no crop available. The main exception is Tobacco mosaic\nvirus, which can remain infective outside a host for years.\nPhytoplasmas \tNo \tAs for viruses with no known exceptions.\nWeeds \tYes (seeds) \tSeeds of weeds can lie dormant for many years and can be\ntransferred to new areas as a contaminant of crop seeds.\nParasitic plants \tYes (seeds) \tAs for weeds.\nMammals \tCan survive for days or weeks without food and will often change\nfood source to what is available.\nBirds \tHighly mobile and can generally find food.\nThe features of pest transmission (how it moves around) will affect the control options available.\nMovement of irrigation water, soil and seed as well as vector behaviour all influence pest\ntransmission. Some insects are weak fliers but can be carried great distances by the wind.\nMites cannot fly but are carried by wind on the fine strands of silk that they spin. Some fungal\nspores blow in from hundreds of miles around, even from other continents.",

Phytophthora can be carried on seed potatoes.\nBacteria are not generally transmitted by wind, but strong wind (especially with rain) can spread bacteria considerable\ndistances.\nNematodes can wriggle short distances (a few centimetres). They can contaminate vegetative planting material if roots are\nincluded. Nematode cysts can be carried on the wind, as can adult nematodes if hidden in soil crumbs. Very few nematodes\nhave specialised relationships with vectors, although red ring disease of coconut is an important example of a nematode that\nis vectored by an insect.\nMites can walk between plants and between crops but this is only important in extremely heavy infestations.\nViruses are generally not transmitted mechanically in the field (through contact with plant material or tools); however there\nare two important exceptions: Tobacco mosaic virus and Potato virus X.\nViruses can be transmitted through seed but this is not especially common.\nSeeds of parasitic plants and weeds commonly contaminate soil and seed lots.\nNote that the table indicates whether any species within a pest group can be transmitted by the means mentioned. It is very\nrare that all the species within a pest group can spread from plant to plant through the same process. For example, several\nspecies of fungi are transmitted through seed but most are not transmitted in this manner.",

In contrast, pathogens which cause disease, such\nas fungi and bacteria, are generally too small to be seen and it is usually the symptoms that are\nused to identify the cause. There are exceptions to this and sometimes you can see the pathogen\n(e.g. fruiting bodies of witches’ broom on cacao) or fail to see the invertebrate pests (e.g. if the pest\nis no longer on the damaged plant or it is too small or too well concealed). Use your skill and training\nto interpret the photographs here and compare them with real samples you see.

    "content": "How big is your garden?\nTo know how much fertilizer to apply, you need to\nknow how big your garden is. To find the square\nfootage of your garden, multiply the width times the\nlength. For example, if your garden is 30 feet long\nand 10 feet wide, it totals 300 square feet (30 x 10).\nThe tables in this publication recommend quantities\nof fertilizer material to apply per 100 square feet.\nFor a 300-square-foot garden, you need three times\nas much fertilizer as you need for a 100-square-foot\ngarden. Multiply width by length to find your garden's square\nfootage.\nCredit: Kruwt, stock.adobe.com\nPlant growth\nSome factors in plant growth — soil type, nutrients, and soil pH — are discussed below. These are only a few of the\nfactors involved in healthy plant growth. Other important practices include plant spacing; insect, weed and disease\ncontrol; irrigation; and timely harvest.\nSoil\nIn many cases, garden soil suffers from a variety of problems. For example:\nTopsoil often is removed or covered with fill material during construction. Although a 2- to 4-inch layer of topsoil\nmay be placed over fill, this shallow layer may not support vigorous plant growth without improvement.\n•\nHeavy construction equipment may compact soil, this slowing root growth and water movement.\t•\nConstruction wastes may be buried near the house. These hidden wastes can lead to sudden death of plants.\t•\nMany soils are naturally \"heavy\" due to high clay content.\t•\nYou can't solve these kinds of problems simply by adding fertilizer. In all of these cases, you need to improve the\nstructure of your soil. The most effective way to improve soil structure is by adding organic matter, such as\ncomposted plant material or aged or composted manure. These materials increase soil workability at the same time\nthey provide nutrients. Since organic matter is \"used up\" over time, you'll need to add it on a regular basis.\nGypsum can improve structure in Eastern Oregon where sodium (Na) is a problem and soil pH is above 8.5, but it\ndoes not appreciably improve clay soils in Western Oregon.\nNutrients\nThe three key nutrients for plant growth are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). These nutrients are\ncontained in most commercial fertilizer mixes. Other materials you may need to add are lime, sulfur, magnesium and\nboron.\n2",

    "content": "Nitrogen is important for healthy plant growth. It usually needs to be applied each year because rain and irrigation\nremove most of the nitrogen not used by plants. Phosphorus is essential for vigorous growth of seedlings, especially\nin cool, wet, spring weather. Potassium is important for disease resistance and starch formation.\nPlants use the most nitrogen during or just before the time of rapid growth. For most plants, this is the best time to\nadd nitrogen.\nIf you apply nitrogen fertilizers late in the growing season, most plants can't efficiently utilize the nitrogen, and the\nexcess is likely to remain in the soil after the growing season. This extra nitrogen is not a groundwater problem in\nthe dry climate of Central and Eastern Oregon. In Western Oregon, however, winter rains will move nitrogen in the\nform of nitrate below the root zone and possibly deposit it in groundwater. Nitrate in groundwater is a contaminant\nthat poses a health risk.\npH\nSoil pH is a measure of how acidic or alkaline a soil is. A soil with low pH (below 7.0) is acidic, while a soil with high\npH (above 7.0) is alkaline (basic).\nVegetables gardens produce well in a soil pH of 6.0–7.0, and lawns do well in a pH of 5.5–6.0. \"Acid-loving\" plants\nsuch as azaleas, blueberries and rhododendrons require a soil pH below 6.0 and preferably 4.5 to 5.5.\nIf soil pH is too low, add lime to make the soil less acidic. For home gardens, first test your soil to determine specific\nlime needs. As a general guideline, use 5 to 10 pounds lime per 100 square feet if mixing into the soil before\nplanting. For established lawns or plants, add 5 pounds per 100 square feet. Apply lime in fall for best results,\nallowing time for it to react with the soil. Retest soil pH three to six months later to see whether you've achieved the\ntarget pH.\nYou can use various methods to acidify the soil if pH is too\nhigh. A soil pH greater than 7.0 is uncommon west of the\nCascades, so gardeners in Western Oregon typically need\nto acidify their soil only if they are growing acid-loving\nplants. Many soils east of the Cascades are very alkaline\nand need to be acidified for all crops. Mixing elemental sulfur with the soil is a safe, effective way to reduce soil pH.\nIf soil pH is too low, add lime to\nmake the soil less acidic.\n3",

    "content": "Types of fertilizer\nOpinions vary concerning the merits of manures or other organic fertilizers versus \"chemical\" fertilizers. Excellent\ngardens may be grown using either method. Plants do not differentiate between nutrients from organic and\nchemical fertilizers; the form absorbed by plant roots from both sources is identical.\nPlants can use chemical fertilizers as soon as they are applied. Soil bacteria and fungi must act on most organic\nnutrient sources to change them into a usable form. Thus, if you use mostly organic fertilizers, you may need to add\na small amount of a source of more readily available nitrogen early in the season to ensure adequate plant nutrition\nuntil the organic sources become available to plants. Options include liquid fish, blood meal and chemical fertilizer.\nPackaged mixes\nBoth chemical and organic fertilizers are available as package mixes containing N, P, K and sometimes sulfur (S).\nPackage labels tell how much of each nutrient the fertilizer contains.\nThe nutrients always are listed in this order on the label: nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium. Thus, a fertilizer labeled 5-\n15-10 contains 5% nitrogen, 15% phosphorus (in the form of phosphate), and 10% potassium (in the form of\npotash). In other words, every 10 pounds of this fertilizer material contains 0.5 pound nitrogen, 1.5 pounds\nphosphorus, and 1 pound potassium (10 lb material x 0.05 N = 0.5 lb N).\nIf a fourth number is listed, it represents sulfur. Thus, a 5-15-10-10 fertilizer also contains a 10% concentration of\nsulfur (in the form of sulfate).\nThe remaining components of the fertilizer material include carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and coating materials.\nMany fertilizers are labeled for specific uses such as roses, azaleas, or vegetables. These specialty blends generally\nare an expensive alternative to standard blends applied at an adequate rate.\nUnblended organic sources\nWood ash\nWood ash is a good source of potassium. You can use ash as a fertilizer and liming material on vegetable gardens,\nflower beds, lawns, and most shrubs. It's particularly useful on acid soils low in potassium.\nThe fertilizer value of wood ash depends on the type of wood burned. Generally, hardwoods weigh more per cord\nthan softwoods and yield more ash per pound of wood. Their ash also contains higher percentages of nutrients.\nAsh from a cord of oak meets the potassium needs of a garden 60 feet by 70 feet (4,200 square feet), and ash from a\ncord of Douglas-fir, a garden 30 feet by 30 feet (900 square feet). Both contain enough calcium and magnesium to\nreduce soil acidity slightly. See Table 4B for application rates.\nElements in ash are water-soluble. Therefore, always store ash in a dry place until you're ready to use it.\nApply ashes evenly, and if possible mix them into the soil. Never leave ashes on the surface in lumps or piles. If ashes\nare concentrated in one place, excessive salt leaches into the soil, creating a harmful environment for plants.\nSpreading wood ashes in a thin layer over your lawn is safer than using them in your garden, where they are more\nlikely to be concentrated in the soil. Apply ash to moist soil and rake it in lightly. Wear eye protection, gloves and a\n4",

    "content": "dust mask when handling ash.\nBe aware of several precautions if you use wood ashes:\nDon't apply wood ashes to acid-loving plants such as blueberries, rhododendrons and azaleas.\t•\nYou may have problems with potato scab, a fungus disease, if you use ashes where you grow potatoes.\t•\nDon't add fertilizer containing nitrogen in the form of ammonium immediately after adding wood ash; the\npresence of ash can result in the loss of ammonia.\n•\nDon't add fresh ashes to newly germinated seeds.\t•\nSome types of ash are not safe to use on plants, including coal ashes, ashes from lead-painted or chemically\ntreated wood, and ashes from fireplaces or incinerators where trash has been burned.\n•\nDon't uses ashes in Eastern and Southeastern Oregon, where soils are naturally high in potassium and soil pH.\t•\nIf the potassium soil test value is above 600 ppm, do not apply wood ashes for five years.\t•\nTest your soil pH first. Do not apply wood ash if your soil pH is already 7.0 or higher.\t•\nApply wood ash in spring rather than in winter, since nutrients may wash away with winter rains.\t•\nGrass clippings\nA 2- to 4-inch layer of grass clippings can be added to gardens as a fertilizer material. Grass clippings are a good\nsource of nitrogen and potassium. Fresh clippings should be applied thinly and mixed into the soil to prevent\nmatting and ensure proper decomposition for nutrient release.\nDo not use fresh clippings from weedy lawns, bentgrass lawns, turf with rhizomes or lawns treated with herbicides.\nThese sources may introduce weeds, unwanted grass or chemical residues..\nManure\nManure can modify the soil structure and water-holding capacity of a garden. In fact, these benefits often are\ngreater than the nutrient benefit of manures.\nManures are extremely variable in their nitrogen content. Table 1 shows typical nutrient contents of various types of\nmanure. As little as 20 pounds of poultry droppings or as much as 150 pounds of manure mixed with straw, shavings\nor sawdust may be required for each 100 square feet.\nMore than 50% of the nitrogen in manure can be lost during storage or after it is applied to the soil surface.\nNitrogen loss is least when manure is applied during the growing season or in late summer, where you have planted\na cover crop. Don't apply manure in fall or early spring because nitrogen is likely to be lost from the soil before\nplants can use it.\nManures often contain weed seeds. Some of these weeds may be very difficult to control. In addition, manure that\nhas been in contact with soil may contain symphylans, insects that can be very damaging to plant roots.\nCompost manure before using it in vegetable gardens. Fresh manure can damage plants and may contain excess\nsalts, viable weed seeds or even human pathogens. If using fresh, uncomposted manure, dig it into the soil at least\n90 days before harvest to reduce the risk of foodborne illness. For crops that touch the soil (lettuce, onions, beets),\nwait 120 days.\n5",

Regardless of the method you use, keep the following facts in\nmind:\nThe nitrogen in chemical fertilizers is highly water-soluble and is carried to the roots by irrigation and rain. Thus,\nyou don't need to mix these materials into the soil, but you do need to water your garden if rain doesn't fall within\na day after you apply them.\n•\nOrganic sources of nitrogen are most accessible to plants if mixed into the top 2–3 inches of soil.\t•\nPhosphate moves slowly in the soil. You'll obtain best results by banding phosphate-containing fertilizer 2 inches\nbelow the seed when you plant or by tilling it into the soil during spring preparation.\n•\nWork potassium fertilizers into the soil using the banding or broadcast methods. Do not allow potassium fertilizer\nto contact plant roots.\n•\nBroadcast\nScatter the material uniformly over the surface. If an application method is not mentioned, broadcasting is implied.\nBand\nPlace the fertilizer in a trench about 3 inches deep. The corner of a hoe works well to make the trench. Sow seeds 1\n1/2 to 2 inches above and to the side of the fertilizer. The plant roots quickly absorb the nutrients and grow rapidly.\nSidedress\nScatter the fertilizer material close to growing plants. Keep fertilizer granules off leaves to prevent burning. Nitrogen\nis very soluble and need not be mixed with the soil. A fertilizer blend containing nitrogen, phosphate, and potash\nshould be lightly scratched in, but take care to avoid damaging plant roots. Apply irrigation so the plants can absorb\nthe nutrients.\n6",

    "content": "Vegetable gardens\nBefore planting\nIf you use a packaged fertilizer mix (organic or chemical)\nUse Table 3 to determine how much fertilizer to apply before planting. The tables are based on soil test results for\nphosphorus and potassium. If you follow these recommendations, you'll automatically apply sufficient nitrogen for\ninitial growth of newly planted seeds and plants.\nIf you live in Western Oregon, choose a fertilizer mix that also contains sulfur (S). Look for a fourth number on the\nfertilizer package, e.g., 10-10-10-10. In Central Oregon, you may wish to try a sulfur-containing fertilizer on a trial\nbasis.\nIf you use unblended organic sources\nUse Table 4A for manure application rates. If the soil test for phosphorus is low, add P according to Table 4C.\nAdditional potassium usually isn't needed unless the soil test for potassium is less than 300 ppm.\nAll of the nutrients in manure are not completely available for first year. Approximately 75% of the nitrogen from\npoultry manure is available the first year, while only 25%–50% of the nitrogen from other manures may be available\nduring this time. Thus, during the first three years of manure application, add a source of more readily available\nnitrogen such as liquid fish, blood meal, or chemical fertilizer. Or triple the amount of manure (with the exception of\npoultry manure) you use (column 1 in Table 4A).\nA note about boron\nMany soils in Western Oregon are deficient in boron (B). Several crops (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, caneberries,\nstrawberries, beets, carrots, etc.) can benefit from an application of boron.\nIf the soil test for boron is less than 1 ppm, apply household or agricultural grade borax (11% B) at the rate of 1\ntablespoon per 100 square feet where boron-requiring plants will be grown. Apply the borax evenly and mix\nthoroughly with the soil. it may be easier to dissolve 1 tablespoon of borax in 1 gallon of water and apply the\nsolution evenly with a sprinkling can. Apply 1 fluid ounce of solution per plant. You can find borax in the cleaning\nsupplies section of most grocery stores.\nBe careful! Excessive quantities of boron are highly toxic to plants, especially young bean plants. One application\nshould be sufficient for up to three years or until another soil test.\nDuring the growing season\nNitrogen is needed for continued healthy growth. If you notice a pale green or yellow color and a slower rate of\ngrowth about four to five weeks after planting, your vegetable plants may need additional nitrogen.\nSidedress 1/2 cup of ammonium sulfate (21-0-0-24) or equivalent fertilizer per 10 feet of row, and then water the\nplants. Do not apply this extra nitrogen to peas or tomatoes. If other nutrients have been omitted, you can add them\nat this time.\n7",

You also can have a laboratory do a leaf and petiole analysis to\ndetermine which nutrients are present in leaf tissue in adequate, deficient, or excessive amounts. To determine the\nneed for lime or sulfur, perform a soil test.\nNitrogen probably is the only nutrient needed in most home orchards. Apply according to Table 2 in the spring\naround the time the trees finish blooming. Broadcast the fertilizer under the entire canopy of the tree. Be careful!\nOne- and 2-year-old trees can be injured if nitrogen is banded around the tree.\nDo not add nitrogen around the base of the tree. Begin fertilizer broadcast at roughly the halfway point between the\ntrunk and the dripline of the tree.

So, a 100-pound bag of 10-20-10 fer-\ntilizer contains 10 pounds of nitrogen, 20\npounds of phosphorus, and 10 pounds of\npotassium. This equals a total of 40 pounds\nof nutrients. The rest of the fertilizer, or 60\npounds in this example, is a carrier or filler\nsuch as sand, perlite, or rice hulls. A complete\nfertilizer is one that in-\ncludes all three elements.\nAll parts of a\nplant need nitrogen\nfor growth—the roots,\nleaves, stems, flowers\nand fruits. Nitrogen gives\nplants their green color\nand is needed to form\nprotein. A lack of ni-\ntrogen causes the lower\nleaves to turn yellow and\nthe whole plant to turn\npale green. On the other\nhand, too much nitro-\ngen kills plants.\nPlants must have light, moisture and\nnutrients to grow. The sun provides\nlight. Moisture comes from rainfall or\nirrigation. Nutrients come from fertilizers,\ncompost or manure.\nIf plants are not growing well, fertiliz-\ning them will help only if a lack of nutrients\nis the cause of the problem. Plants grown in\npoorly drained soils, in excessive shade, or in\ncompetition with tree roots will not respond\nto fertilizer.\nFertilizers are either organic or inor-\nganic. Examples of organic fertilizers include\nmanure (poultry, cow or horse), bone meal,\ncottonseed, or other naturally occurring\nmaterials. Inorganic fertilizers are manmade\nproducts. They usually have a higher nutri-\nent content.\nBuying Fertilizers\nThe three numbers on fertilizer contain-\ners are the fertilizer analysis (Fig. 1).

Dig down\nabout 4 to 6 inches and take a handful of\nsoil. Do this in several different places in the\ngarden. Place each handful of soil in a large\ncontainer and mix. From this mixture, take\nabout ½ pint of soil for the sample (Fig. 2).\nPhosphorus is needed for cell division\nand to help form roots, flowers and fruit.\nPhosphorus deficiency causes stunted growth\nand poor flowering and fruiting.\nPlants need potassium for many of the\nchemical processes that allow them to live\nand grow. A potassium shortage shows up in\nvarious ways, but stunted growth and yellow-\nish lower leaves are common symptoms in\nmany plants.\nWhen you buy fertilizer, consider the\ncost per pound of the nutrient(s). Gener-\nally, higher analysis fertilizers and larger\ncontainers are less expensive. For example, a\n50-pound bag of 10-20-10 may not cost any\nmore than a 50-pound bag of 5-10-5 fertil-\nizer, but the 10-20-10 bag contains twice the\nnutrients.\nFertilizer Selection\nMost gardeners should use a complete\nfertilizer with twice as much phosphorus as\nnitrogen or potassium. An example would be\n10-20-10 or 12-24-12. These fertilizers usually\nare easy to find.\nSome soils contain enough potassium\nfor good plant growth and don’t need more.\nBut since a slight excess of potassium will not\ninjure plants, it is usually best to use a com-\nplete fertilizer.\nDo not use lawn fertilizers on gardens.\nThey contain too much nitrogen, and many\nhave chemicals for lawn weed control that\ncan injure or kill vegetables.\nSoils with pH levels below 5.7 need lime.\nLime adds calcium to the soil and makes it\nless acidic, raising pH to an acceptable level.\nUsing Fertilizer\nGardeners should have their soil tested\nabout every 2 years. This is especially impor-\ntant for beginning gardeners who are unfa-\nmiliar with growing plants. A soil test clearly\nFigure 2. Take soil samples from several areas of\nthe garden and mix them together.\nSoil can be tested in midwinter to pre-\npare for spring planting. County Extension\nagents can give you a soil sample container\nand explain where to send the sample for\ntesting.\nIf the garden soil has not been tested,\nuse 2 to 3 pounds of fertilizer such as 10-20-\n10 for every 100 square feet of garden area. A\nplot 10 x 10 feet (or 5 x 20 feet) would be 100\nsquare feet (Fig.\n3). If a garden\nis 30 feet long\nand the rows\nare 3 feet apart,\neach row is\nalmost 100\nsquare feet. Use\n2 pounds of\nfertilizer if the\ngarden is sandy\nand 3 pounds\nif the soil is\nmostly clay.\nFigure 3.

One of the most important and necessary resource is fertilizer,\nwhich provides the nutrients needed by plants to grow properly and yield a quality\nproduct.\nFertilizers account for one-third or more of crop yields. Inadequate fertility starves\nplants. Excess fertility is wasted and can cause physical injury and death to plants\nas well as pollution to the environment. It is necessary therefore to supply plants\nwith precise and balanced amounts of nutrients needed for their optimal growth\nand development but avoiding excessive amounts that can be eventually lost to the\nenvironment.\nThe inefficient use of fertilizers is generally a cause for concern. Issues such as nitrate\nleaching, eutrophication and consumption of non-renewable resources originate\nwith fertilizer use. Further, farmers need to understand the risks associated with\nthe indiscriminate use, storage and handling of fertilizers. Additionally, they also\nneed to be cognizant of the environmental and occupational hazards associated\nwith the misuse of fertilizers.\nThe purpose of this manual is to educate farmers (both rice and other crops) on\nenvironmental and sustainability issues related to fertilizers. The basic concepts\nrelated to fertilizer use, types of fertilizers, methods of application, efficient use\nof fertilizers, storage, handling and environmental hazards are given prominence.",

Farmers are generally aware when this condition arises. They\nusually refer to their soils in this state as being ‘run down’. Farmers invariably use\nfertilizers and manures to correct this problem. A fertilizer is a material that provides\none or more elements (nutrients or plant food) for the growth and development\nof plant. The use of fertilizers has become an essential and routine part of many\ncrop production systems. Farmers do not use fertilizers just to grow big crops or to\nincrease the nutrient content of their soils. They do so to make a living. As a result,\nany fertilizer practice must be technically correct to ensure it gives a fair economic\nreturn to the farmers.\n2.2 \tPlant nutrients\nPlant nutrients are chemical elements that are essential for the growth and\ndevelopment of plants.\n2.2.1 \tClassification\nThere are 17 nutrients that are required for the growth and development of plants\n(Table 1). Additionally, some nutrients such as silicon (Si) are also necessary for\nsuccessful rice production.\nTable 1: Classification of Elements Essentials for Plant Growth\nClassification \tElements\nMacronutrients \t(Available from air or\nwater)\nCarbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen\nPrimary Nutrients \tNitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium\nSecondary Nutrients \tCalcium, Magnesium, Sulphur\nMicronutrients \tBoron, Cobalt, Chlorine, Copper,\nIron, Manganese, Molybdenum,\nZinc",

Of these, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen,\n(make up 90-95% of the dry matter of plants) are obtained from carbon dioxide\nand water. These nutrients are therefore not regarded as components of fertilizers.\nThe other major elements are divided into primary nutrients (nitrogen, potassium\nand phosphorus) and secondary nutrients (calcium, magnesium and surplus). The\nremaining eight plant nutrients are required in much smaller quantities are known\nas micronutrients or minor elements.\n2.2.2 \tRoles and functions of plant nutrients\nPlant nutrients obtained from the soil are essential for the growth of healthy plants.\nThe nutrients are utilized by plants during the basic metabolic processes which are\nabsolutely essential for the continued life of all plants.

When\nthe soil itself cannot supply the quantities of nutrients needed by the plant, best\nyields would not be obtained unless the shortage of plant nutrients is made up by\napplying the missing substances as fertilizers. A fertilizer is a material, the main\nfunction of which is to provide plant nutrients.\n3.2 \tKinds of Fertilizers\nFertilizers are classified into two categories – inorganic and organic. The inorganic\n(mineral) fertilizer is a substance in which the declared nutrients are in the form of\ninorganic salts obtained by extraction and/or by physical and/or chemical industrial\nprocesses. Organic fertilizers are carbonaceous materials mainly of vegetable and/\nor animal origin added to the soil specifically for the nutrition of plants.\nInorganic fertilizers include urea (source of N), TSP (Source of P), muriate of potash\n(source of K) and compound fertilizers such as 15:15:15 (Figure 1). Inorganic\nfertilizers could be granular, coated, slow-release, etc.\nOrganic fertilizers (manures) are derived from the wastes of plants and animals. Litter\nfrom poultry, cows, sheep, etc., are commonly used for fertilization. Decomposed\norganic materials (composts) are the most common organic fertilizers.\n3.3 \tComposition of Some Common Fertilizers\nFertilizers exist in many forms. Some compounds such as urea {CO (NH2)2},\nmuriate of potash (KCI) and TSP provide only one plant nutrient. Others, such as\ndiammonium phosphate contain two nutrients (N and P). The typical composition\nof some common fertilizers is shown in Table 4.\nTable 4: Composition of some common fertilizers\nName \tComposition\nUrea \t45% - 46%N\nMuriate of Potash (KCI) \t60% - 62% K2\nO\nDiammonium Phosphate (DAP) \t18%N, 46% P2\nO 5\nTriple Superphosphate (TSP) \t44% - 48% P2\nO 5",

This set of numbers is called the grade of the fertilizer product. The\ncontent of each nutrient is always expressed as a percentage by weight, or in other\nwords as kilograms of nutrients per 100 kg of the fertilizer product.\nUsually, three numbers are used when giving the grade of a fertilizer product, and\nthese three numbers always refer, in order, to the content of the primary nutrients:\nN, P and K. If other nutrients are present, the content can also be indicated in the\ngrade of the fertilizer product. The grades of some of the common fertilizers used\nin Guyana are shown below.\nUrea \t- \t46-0-0\nMuriate of Potash \t- \t62-0-0\nDAP \t- \t18-46-0\nTSP \t- \t46-0-0\nMany commercial fertilizers are mixtures of compounds (compound fertilizers)\nwhich provide substantial amounts of N, P and K. In Guyana, some of the commonly\nused mixed fertilizers are 20:20:20 and 15:15:15. Another commonly recommended\nfertilizer for sandy soils is 12-12-17-2. This latter mixed fertilizer contains 2kg of\nmicronutrients in addition of 12kg of N, 12 kg of P2O5 and 17 kg of K2O per 100kg\nof fertilizer.\n3.5 \tCompound Fertilizers\nCompound fertilizers are frequently used because it is more convenient to purchase,\ntransport, store and apply one product than several as is the case if one chooses\nto use individual nutrient sources such as urea, muriate of potash or TSP. However,\nin many instances a single dose of a compound fertilizer will not meet the nutrient\nneeds of the crop over the entire growing season.\nCompound fertilizers are often a good choice for providing a basal application of\nnutrients, including secondary and micro-nutrients, prior to or at planting. However,\nbecause most crops benefit from higher doses of nitrogen than other nutrients, the\nbasal dose of compound fertilizer often needs to be followed by subsequent doses\nof nitrogen timed to meet the nitrogen requirements of the crop.",

Other compound fertilizers such as 20-20-20 are also in the\nmarket. A description of some of their basic properties is presented below.\n4.2 \tUrea\nOn a worldwide basis, urea is the most popular solid nitrogen fertilizer. In its pure\nstate, it is a white, crystalline organic compound. In the fertilizer form, urea may\nhave a grayish appearance.\nUrea is the recommended N fertilizer for rice. It is preferable to other N containing\nfertilizers for flooded rice because nitrates are reduced to gaseous nitrogen (N2O\nor N2) in the anerobic (no oxygen) zone of the rice paddy and hence lost to the\natmosphere. Furthermore, the rice plant, unlike most other crops, can utilize the\nammonium form of nitrogen efficiently.\n4.2.1 \tBehaviour of Urea in Soils\nWhen urea is added to the soil, it is acted upon by an enzyme called urease (very\nabundant in soils). The urease converts urea to ammonium (NH4+) ions. In flooded\nsoils (such as rice paddies), the NH4+ ion is available for uptake by rice plants. This\nprocess takes a few days. This ion can also be converted to the nitrate (NO3-) ion\nin the aerobic zone around the root hairs. These nitrate ions are then available for\nplant uptake.\nIn soils that are not flooded, urea is first converted to NH4+ which is subsequently\nconverted to NO3- by soil bacteria. The NO3- ion then becomes available for uptake\nby plants (fruits and vegetables).\n4.2.2 \tUrea Application\nSurface applications of urea are most efficient when they are washed into the soil\nor applied to soils that have low levels of urease. Urea moves in soils very easily\nonce adequate moisture is available. Apart from rice, once urea is used, it must be\nincorporated into the soil and MUST NOT REMAIN ON THE SURFACE.",

Loss of urea can\noccur if there is significant precipitation soon after application and before there has\nbeen sufficient time for the necessary reactions to occur.\n4.3 \tMuriate of Potash\nMuriate of Potash (KCI) is the most commonly used K fertilizer. It is orangish in\ncolour, water soluble and contains 60 to 62% K2O.\n4.3.1 \tBehaviour in Soils\nWhen potash is added to the soil, it dissolves in the soil moisture, releasing K+ ions,\nwhich are available for plant uptake.\nIt is vital to maintain adequate K fertility levels in the soil because K does not move\nmuch, except in sandy and organic soils. K tends to remain where fertilization puts\nit. When K does more, it is usually by diffusion on slow, short trips through water\nfilms surrounding soil particles.\n4.4 \tPhosphate Fertilizers\nThe two most common phosphate fertilizers are diammonium phosphate (DAP)\nwhich contains 18%N and 46% P2O5 and concentrated phosphate or triple\nsuperhosphate (TSP). Both TSP and DAP are used in rice cultivation. Fruit and\nvegetable growers utilize TSP extensively. These materials are marketed as gray,\nbrown or white materials in either powdered or granular form.\n4.4.1 \tBehaviour in Soils\nThe effectiveness of P fertilizers is determined by the properties of both P salt and\nthe soil being fertilized as well as by the reactions between the P fertilizer and the\nvarious soil constituents. When P fertilizers are applied to the soil, these dissolve\nrapidly even under conditions of low soil moisture. A nearly saturated solution of\nthe fertilizer material forms in and around the fertilizer granules.\nP moves very little in most soils. It generally stays, where it is placed by fertilization.\nLittle P is lost by leaching, though it moves more freely in sandy than in clay soils.",

The soluble\nconstituents of fertilizers diffuse through the soil vertically and only slightly in a\nlateral direction. The method of application, therefore, must ensure distribution to\nreach the plant roots.\nThere are three methods generally used for fertilizer applications. These are\nbroadcast, placement and foliar application. Fertilizer requirements vary for the\ndifferent crop types. In this manual, emphasis is placed on fertilization of fruits,\nvegetable and rice.\n5.2 \tBroadcast\nIn this method the fertilizer is spread as uniformly over the field as possible. This\nis commonly referred to as ‘shying’. This method is suitable for crops whose seeds\nare broadcast as is done in rice cultivation. The fertilizer is usually broadcast after\nthe land has been ploughed and then mixed with the soil ploughs or cultivators.\n5.3 \tPlacement\nPlacement is when the fertilizer is put in a small area close to the plant or seed. This\ncould be done in spots or as bands.\nThe spot placement: the fertilizer is put approximately 5 cm (2 inches) away from\nthe seed and 5 cm below the soil. The fertilizer should not be left exposed on the\nsurface of the soils. This will lead to the loss of fertilizer. This method is useful for\ncrops such as corn, bean, pumpkin, squash, melons and cucumber which have large\nseeds.\nIn band placement: the fertilizer is placed in bands on one side or both sides of\nthe row, about 5 cm below the seed and 5 cm away from the seed or plant. This\nmethod is useful for crops which are sensitive to direct contact with fertilizers.",

    "content": "18\nBand placement is also used for tree crops such as citrus, coconuts, avocado and\npapaws. In this case, the fertilizer is put in a circular band around the tree. Trees are\nusually treated individually, the fertilizer being applied around each tree within the\nspread of the branches, but beginning a few meters from the trunk. Generally, the\nfertilizer is placed around the dripline of the plant canopy. The fertilizer must be\nworked into the soil as much as possible after application.\n5.4 \tFoliar application\nThis is the application of fertilizer directly to the foliage of the plant as a liquid\nspray. The nutrients can be absorbed directly by plant leaves although only in\nlimited quantities.\n5.5 \tNPK Placement and Movement\nThe placement and movement of N, P and K are illustrated in Figure 1.\nFigure1: NPK Placement and Movement\nNitrogen moves through the soil rather freely during the grow-\ning season. Positioning N in the root zone is generally not\ncritical for root interception in clean tillage systems. However,\nband placement of N has been shown to significantly enhance\nN use efficiency under reduced tillage conditions Band place-\nment of N can also slow the nitrification process.\nPhosphorus needs most attention with its placement. This\nillustration shows how very limited its movement really is.\nPhosphorus should be placed where roots can intercept it.\nBanding P is the most agronomically efficient way to place it\non low fertility soils. Banding ammonium-N with P enhances\nP uptake.\nPotassium placement is critical. Like P, it does not move read-\nily in the soil. Broadcast application is generally most effec-\ntive, sometimes in combination with band placement. Band\nplacement of K in conservation tillage systems can signifi-\ncantly improve K availability, probably related to plant rooting\npatterns. Deep banding K has been very important in helping\novercome subsoil K deficiency in cotton.",

Organic fertilizers have much lower nutrient\ncontents than synthetic mineral fertilizers. Thus, large quantities (tons/ha) are\nrequired. However, they have some advantages such as slow nutrient release\n(mineralization), tendency not to damage roots, provision of micronutrients and\nimprovement of soil structure.\nOrganic fertilizers are generally spread on the soil surface and then worked into\nthe soil. These materials can also be left on the soil surface, initially serving as a\nmulch. This is a useful practice in vegetable production. For tree crops, the organic\nfertilizer should be placed in a circular band, approximately around the dripline.\nThe fertilizer materials should be subsequently mulched.\n5.7 \tFertilizing Vegetables\nOn small areas such as garden beds or vegetables banks, the recommended\nfertilizer may be broadcasted evenly, over the planting area and lightly raked in.\nNo fertilizer should be left exposed in the soil surface. If small amounts of fertilizer\nare to applied (a few grams) then this should be dissolved in a watering can. The\nfertilizer solution should then be evenly applied over the area to be planted.\nSpot placement is used when planting crops such as beans, corn, squash, pumpkins,\nmelons and cucumbers, which have large seeds. The fertilizer should be put\napproximately 5 cm (2 inches) away from the seed and 5 cm (2 inches) below the\nsoil. After placement, the fertilizer must be covered with soil.\nFor crops that are planted close together in rows such as corn, beans and eschallot,\nband placement of fertilizer is recommended. In organized planting of crops such\nas peppers, boulanger and tomatoes, band placement of fertilizers is also effective.",

The distance of the band from the row varies with the crop type.\nFor crops such as corn, and beans, the fertilizer is placed 22 cm (9 inches) from\nthe row crop. In the case of eschallots, celery, lettuce, cabbage and pak choi, the\nfertilizer is placed 7-10 cm (3-4 inches) away from the row of crop.\nA soil test is generally recommended for efficient fertilizer application. In the\nabsence of a soil test, the recommendation in the Farmers’ Manual (Homenauth,\n2007) should be followed.\n5.8 \tFertilizing Fruit Crops\nFertilizing fruit crops begins with the preparation of the planting holes, since most\nfruit crops are transplanted. Planting holes should be at least 60 cm (2 feet) across\nif circular or of 60 cm side, if square, and 60 cm deep. The soil from the top 30 cm\nof the hole should be kept separate from the soil below this depth.\nThe soil from each portion of the hole should be mixed with manure, compost\nor the appropriate mineral fertilizer. The soil from the top half of the hole, after\nmixing, should be put in the bottom. The remaining soil should be placed when\ntransplanting occurs. It is always advisable that when filled, the top of the hole\nshould be a mound about 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 inches) higher than the surrounding\narea. This allows for settling of the soil and prevents water logging of the young\ntree.\nRecommendations for fertilizer applications are dependent on the type of fruit\ncrop. Generally, either annual or bi-annual applications of fertilizers or manures\nare required. When fertilizers are to applied, these should be placed in a circular\nband around the tree. Fertilizer application should not be beyond the drip line. This\nis the recommended practice for crops such a coconuts, citrus, avocado and papaw.\nA slight modification of this method of incorporation is to band the fertilizer at\nthree or four places under the tree. Again, this should not be beyond the dripline.\nThe various fruit crop require different rates and timing of fertilizer application.\nMany of these recommendations are provided in the Farmers’ Manual (Homenauth,\n2007).",

Efficiency of\nfertilizer use by crops is of major agronomic interest. There is growing concern that\nfertilizers be used as efficiently as possible to minimize losses and environmental\npollution.\n7.2 \tLoss of Soil Nutrients\nNutrients are lost from the environment through crop removal, leaching,\ndentrification, volatilization and erosion.\n7.1.1 \tCrop Removal\nThe nutrients that are taken up by crops are responsible for the major depletion\nof nutrients in the soil. Fertilizers are used to replenish these nutrients in an\neconomical way.\n7.2.2 \tLeaching\nLeaching is a serious factor in sandy soils (light -textured ) and well drained soils.\nLeaching is primarily responsible for the loss of potassium, magnesium and calcium\nfrom the soil. The nitrate form of nitrogen is also very susceptible to leaching.\n7.2.3 \tDentrification\nDentrification is the loss of nitrogen (either in the form of nitrons oxide or nitrogen\ngas) from the soil. The process occurs when soils become depleted of oxygen\n(under waterlogged conditions).\n7.2.4 \tVolatilisation\nVolatilisation is the loss of nutrients through evaporation. This only affects\nammonia. Losses can be very high when ammonia or ammonia producing fertilizers\nare improperly applied.\n7.2.5 \tErosion\nErosion is responsible for the loss of the greatest quantities of nutrients from the\nsoil as well as causing soil degradation. Phosphorous is the nutrient most affected\nby erosion.",

These arise from plant nutrient transfers out of the soil/crop system.\nThe harmful modifications induced by these transfers are shown below:\n7.4 \tFertilizer Use and the Environment\nThe inefficient use of fertilizers can result in environmental pollution. The ways\nthrough which pollution occurs are eutrophication, high nitrate levels in water, soil\nacidification and greenhouse gas emissions.\n7.4.1 \tEutrophication\nEutrophication is a process whereby water bodies such a trenches, canals, lakes,\netc., receive excess nutrients (such as nitrate from applied fertilizer N) that cause\nexcessive plant growth (algae, weeds, etc.). The resulting increased plant growth\nsignificantly reduces the amount dissolved oxygen in the water. This can result\nin the death of animals species (fauna) in the water. Visually, water may become\ncloudy and discoloured (green, yellow, brown or red).\nEutrophication results from high application rates of inorganic fertilizers in order\nto maximize crop yields. Further, the high solubilities of these fertilizers leads to\nincreased run-off as well as leaching into the groundwater.\n7.4.2 \tHigh Nitrate Levels in Water\nNitrate ion which result from the application of N fertilizers to soil can be leached\ninto groundwater or transported into drainage canals. Levels of nitrate above 10\nmg/L (10pppm) are toxic. Water with there levels of nitrate should not be used for\ndrinking purposes.\n7.4.3 \tSoil Acidification\nThe continuous use of N containing inorganic and organic fertilizers can result in soils\nbecoming acidic. This has a bearing on the availability of soil nutrients especially\nphosphorus and some micronutrients.

The storage and handling of fertilizers is not a serious\nissue in Guyana. Most farmers only purchase the quantities that are needed at\na particular time. Some amount of storage is however required by rice farmers.\nFertilizers are always bagged when stored.\n8.2 \tStorage and Handling of Fertilizers\nThe bulk of the fertilizers used by farmers in Guyana is in the bagged form. There\nare certain basic requirements for the storage and handling of bagged fertilizers.\n8.2.1 \tUse of Pallets\nWhen bagged fertilizer is to be stored, the bags should be stacked to prevent them\nfrom falling. The bags should be checked for soundness and the storage area must\nbe kept dry. For periods of long storage, pallets should be used to keep the bags\noff the floor or ground and out of the way of activities that might cause the bags\nto open.\n8.2.2. \tHandling Damaged Bags\nIf a bag is accidentally damaged, re-bagging should be done. It is also advisable\nto use this fertilizer as soon as possible. A dry hard clean surface underneath the\nstorage area will greatly improve the farmer’s ability to recover spills and reduce\nthe possibility of contamination.",

The storage area must be properly covered to\nprevent rainwater from entering. It should also be adequately ventilated.\nSome fertilizers such as urea are hygroscopic, i.e. they absorb water from the air\nwhich can result in ‘caking’ of the fertilizing. This makes handling and application\nvery difficult. Further, this can result in over application of the fertilizer which can\nresult in fertilizer ‘burns’.\nCare must also be taken to ensure that fertilizers do not remain on the handler’s\nbody. This can result in burns as well as in some cases allergies. Continuous use of\nthe hands to handle fertilizers result in the palms feeling ‘thin’ (like some of outer\nskin membranes are lost).

Soils have many functions,\nincluding a medium for plant growth,\na key component of the water cycle,\na habitat for organisms, and an engi-\nneering medium. These functions allow\nsoils to provide multiple ecosystem\nservices, particularly in agriculture\nwhere we typically think of soil as being\na medium for plant growth to produce\nfood, fuel and fiber. It provides income\nfor millions of people.\nIt takes an estimated 500 to 1,000\nyears to form one inch of topsoil. For\nthis reason, soil is not considered a\nrenewable resource. On a global basis,\nsoils are being lost due to erosion, with\nestimates of 20 to 30 billion tons of soil\nlost per year due to water erosion and\nat least two billion tons of soil lost per\nyear due to wind erosion. U.S. growers\nlose an estimated $100 million in farm\nincome each year due to soil erosion.\nIn Arkansas, estimates of soil\nerosion in the delta region range from\none to five tons of soil lost per acre per\nyear due to water erosion. A dime’s\nthickness of soil eroded from an acre\nequals roughly 10 tons. This represents\na significant loss of nutrients and our\nmost fertile soil layer. When we take a\nstep back and realize how much humans\nrely on the soil as the foundation of our\nlives, families, communities and liveli-\nhoods, we begin to appreciate measures\nto protect this valuable resource.\nWhat is Soil Health?\nAccording to the U.S. Department\nof Agriculture’s Natural Resources\nConservation Service (USDA-NRCS), soil\nhealth is the continued capacity of the soil\nto function as a vital living ecosystem that\nsustains plants, animals and humans. To\nfunction properly, the soil’s properties —\ncategorized as biological, chemical or\nphysical — must be sufficient to promote\nthe soil-health concept.\nMethods to improve soil health are\nnot “organic” farming or “low input”\nfarming but rather farming systems\nthat recognize the need to view soils\nin a holistic manner. This means con-\nsidering management practices that\nnot only seek to optimize soil chemical/\nfertility properties, but soil physical and\nbiological properties as well. While soil\nhealth means different things to dif-\nferent people, the act of improving soil\nhealth uses agronomic principles that\nmost people can agree upon.\nSoil health, in an agricultural\nsetting, refers to a soil’s capacity for pro-\nduction of food, fuel, or fiber. Increases\nin soil health should lead to increases\nin productivity or profitability of our\ncrop production systems. The chemical,\nbiological, and physical properties that\nmake up soil can be divided into two\ndistinct groups: inherent soil properties\nand dynamic soil properties.\nInherent soil properties are the\ncharacteristics of a soil that form over\nhundreds to thousands of years and are\ntypically not influenced by land use and\nmanagement. Examples of inherent soil\nproperties include soil texture, clay\ntype, depth to bedrock, and drainage\nclassification.\nDynamic soil properties are chemical,\nbiological, and physical characteristics\nthat change with land management and\ncultural practices.

Measurements of dynamic soil proper-\nties are indicators of soil function and overall soil health.\nIn general, increasing organic matter will increase soil\nhealth, as organic matter impacts or is related to many\nof the dynamic soil properties that promote soil functions\nand increase overall soil productivity.\nSoil health is a new and emerging area of soil science\nthat requires research and data to define how cultural\nmanagement practices impact soil functionality, crop pro-\nductivity and producer profitability. Key components of\nincreasing soil organic matter and increasing soil health\nare improvements to soil water infiltration and soil water-\nholding capacity, which can lead to significant yield gains\nin rainfed/dryland production systems.\nHow will increases in organic matter impact yield\nin irrigated systems? Since water is not often limiting in\nirrigated systems, we may not see big yield increases in\nour Arkansas production systems. However, improved soil\nhealth that leads to increased water infiltration and water\nretention can mean greater water use efficiency and a\nreduction in input costs, leading to increases in producer\nprofitability. Improved soil health may not always lead\nto greater yields but will almost always result in greater\nprofitability.\nThere are three primary ways that soil health can\nbenefit the people of Arkansas: increased productivity,\nincreased profitability, and protection of natural resources,\nincluding air, soils, and ecosystems, as well as surface and\ngroundwater resources.\nThe Arkansas Soil Health Partnership is working\nto answer the many remaining questions related to soil\nhealth in Arkansas. The partnership is a collaborative\neffort of several organizations (Table 1) to better define\nsoil health and refine conservation practices in order to\nrealize the potential benefits of improved soil health.\nWhy is Soil Health a Growing Trend in\nAgriculture?\nProtecting the soil we have now is key to maintaining\nagricultural production into the future. The Soil Health\nInstitute was formed in 2015 through a private endow-\nment. This organization promotes national research on\nsoil health and defining soil health metrics for a wide\nvariety of crop production systems in the United States.\nThe USDA-NRCS has launched a major soil health ini-\ntiative, “Unlock the Secrets in the Soil,” which provides\nfinancial assistance to growers to implement healthy soil\npractices.\nAgricultural supply chains concerned with sustain-\nability of natural resources have adopted soil health as a\nconsideration in documenting continuous improvement.\nFor example, the U.S. Cotton trust protocol employs\nmetrics, many of which are directly influenced by soil\nhealth, to help farmers document and ensure sustainable\ncotton production.\nIn Arkansas, the Arkansas Soil Health Alliance\n(ASHA) has led the effort to develop and use healthy soil\nconcepts to improve profitability amid low commodity\nprices and the ever-increasing cost of agronomic inputs.\nMembers have observed changes in their soil, reduced\nirrigation and other inputs, and increased profitability\nover several years of implementing soil-health-building\npractices including the use of cover crops and reducing\ntillage.\nHow do I Improve the Health of My Soil?\nThere are five basic principles for protecting and\nimproving soil health as shown in table 2.\nTable 1.

Photo of a split field demonstration comparing a cover crop and no-till to a conventionally tilled field,\ncourtesy of Dr. Bill Robertson, University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Cotton Agronomist.\nTable 2. The 5 Principles to Build Soil Health\n1. Reduce or minimize soil disturbance.\n2. Keep the soil covered.\n3. Keep living roots growing during as much of the year as possible.\n4. Promote biodiversity above and below the soil surface.\n5. Integration of livestock through grazing (optional).\nManagement practices that address one or all of these\nprinciples will increase the function of soil over time. In\nan ideal scenario, we would implement practices that\naddress all factors, but even the adoption of one or two\npractices can lead to improvement in soil health. In the\nfollowing sections we will break down each of the com-\nponents for improving soil health.\nReducing or Minimizing Soil Disturbance\nTillage has been a routine practice for generations\nof row crop producers. At one time, tillage was needed\nto prepare the seedbed, control weeds, manage residue\nand repair a field’s surface. Minimum tillage is now\nwidely used in Arkansas and is certainly feasible in\nmodern agriculture.\nThe main detriments of tillage to soil health are\nthe reduction of soil organic matter, loss of top-soil due\nto increased erosion potential, release of greenhouse\ngasses, and the destruction of soil structure. Anything\nwe can do to reduce or eliminate tillage in our production\nsystems will improve soil structure, overall soil health,\nincrease soil organic matter, and reduce erosion.\nReducing tillage also reduces input costs, leading to\nincreased profitability. For example, soybean growers\nwho switch from using stale seedbed or conventional\ntillage systems to no-tillage production practices save\nan estimated $30 to $50 per acre per year. In rice, and\nother more traditionally tillage-intensive crops, the\nsavings could be much greater.\nKeep the Soil Covered\nUnder most sub-humid environments, such as present\nin Arkansas, nature works to try to keep soils covered\nthroughout the year. In most undisturbed soil settings,\neven with low inherent soil fertility, nature will provide\nvegetation. The vegetation is often diverse even if it is\ncomprised of undesired species, such as weeds.\nIn modern agriculture, fields are often left fallow\nduring the non-crop-growing season, yet nature will still\ntry to cover soils with winter weeds that often have to\nbe controlled near planting. The benefits of keeping soil\ncovered year-round include a reduction in soil erosion,\npreservation of the seedbeds and rows, providing live\nplant stock to promote soil biology, preservation of soil\nstructure, prevention of unwanted weeds and reduction\nof soil crusting for spring planted cash crops.\nCover crops provide a flexible option of vegetative\ncover that can be planted in the typically fallow windows\nof the year. Cover crops were routinely used before the\nadvent of modern weed control and commercial fertilizers,\nprimarily to control weeds and to promote nutrient cycling\nby using cover crops as green manures.\nIn addition to reducing tillage, residue management\ncan have a profound impact on soil health. Burning or\nremoving crop residues removes valuable nutrients from\nthe field, and most of the organic material that could\nbe used to increase soil organic matter is either lost as\ncarbon dioxide or transported elsewhere.\nSlight changes to fall residue-management practices\ncan significantly benefit soil health through additional soil\nprotection and soil organic matter. Allowing crop residues\nto remain on the soil surface will provide a barrier and\nhelp keep the soil covered. The breakdown and decom-\nposition of this residue will be the foundation of the soil\norganic matter pool.",

    "content": "Keep Living Roots Growing as Much as Possible\nMaintaining ground cover with vegetation also helps\npromote the third principal of soil health, keeping roots\nalive and growing as long as possible throughout the year.\nWhile the biomass above the ground is important, the\nbiomass below ground is just as important to the function\nof soils. Soils can be covered with plant residue, mulch,\nand water to protect soil from erosion, but these options\ndon’t provide living roots in the soil throughout the year.\nHaving a living cover, such as cover crops, provides a food\nsupply for soil microbes and other ecological features that\npromote nutrient cycling.\nAs roots grow and senesce, they often provide the soil\nbiota with carbon, the functional building block of life on\nearth. Soil biota — particularly, bacteria and fungi — are\nthe foundational layer of the soil food pyramid and allow\nfor a diverse assortment of micro- and macro-organisms.\nLiving roots in the soil aid in the protection of soil struc-\nture and development of channels and larger pores in the\nsoil to promote greater rooting of a cash crop and greater\nair and water movement down the soil profile.\nAs living roots within the soil grow, die and decay,\nthey can have a profound impact on the physical charac-\nteristics of the soil. Living roots associate with mycorrhizal\nfungi that produce a chemical called glomalin that facil-\nitates increased soil aggregation and overall soil organic\nmatter. Furthermore, the symbiotic relationship between\nplant roots and soil fungi populations may offer increased\nsurvival rate for plants under environmental stress. While\nwinter weeds can cover the soil and provide living roots,\nweeds in general are often shallow rooted and do not\nprovide the below-ground biomass that cover crops can\nprovide.\nPromote Biodiversity Above and Below the Soil Surface\n“Plant diversity,” as it relates to soil health, is the\nconcept that a diverse mix of plants, mimicking what\none would naturally find on undisturbed, non-agricultural\nland, is essential to soil health.\nGenerally speaking, plants photosynthesize sunlight,\nabsorb carbon from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,\nand form symbiotic interactions with the soil. The plant\ncarbon is then transferred into the soil through root\nexudates, which feed soil microorganisms and help build\norganic matter and soil structure. In return, the soil\nmicrobial populations help cycle soil nutrients, such as\ncarbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, making them avail-\nable for plant uptake.\nEach plant species releases different exudates, so\nroots interact with multiple types of soil life. Diversity\nabove ground equals diversity below ground, leading to\na more complete and functional soil food web. Diversity\namong soil microbial populations may bring “functional\nredundancy,” as many different species can perform the\nsame functions. This redundancy in functions may lead\nto a more resilient soil ecosystem, especially against\nsudden environmental stress such as drought or freezing\ntemperatures.\nMost plants are in one\nof four primary groups:\nwarm-season grasses,\ncool-season grasses,\nwarm-season broadleaves\nor cool-season broad-\nleaves. Ideally, all plant\ngroups will be included\nsomewhere in your crop\nrotation or as a cover crop\nbecause, again, a diverse\nmix of plants mimics\nnature. It’s even better\nif more than one plant\ngroup is growing at the\nsame time. While it’s often\nimpractical to grow more\nthan one cash crop in a\nfield at the same time, crop rotation aided by cover crop\nblends can optimize plant diversity and ensure a more\nconsistent energy source for soil microbes.\nLivestock Integration Through Grazing (Optional)\nAnother practice to build and protect soil is livestock\nintegration through grazing, which promotes nutrient\nrecycling. While some may consider this practice optional,\nit greatly enhances the holistic approach of integrating all\nfour basic principles toward building soil health.\nBefore modern meat production turned to animal con-\nfinement for increased production efficiency, livestock were\nraised primarily by grazing grasslands and cover crops.\nMany believe this creates greater symbiosis with plants\nand soils that provides benefits — but it’s often easier to\nsee potential benefits than to measure and differentiate\nactual changes in individual soil properties with respect to\ndifferent soil management practices.\nFigure 2.

    "content": "101-2\nIntegrated Pest Management, IPM\nIntegrated Pest Management, IPM, is a multi-prong approach to pest\nmanagement. IPM incorporates a variety of management strategies\nincluding cultural, mechanical, biological and chemical methods.\nObjectives include minimizing pest damage and health and environmental\nhazards while maintaining profitability and/or aesthetics.\nBecause insect and disease problems vary significantly from crop to crop,\napplication of IPM principles is also often crop specific. IPM techniques\nused in an alfalfa field (perennial crop), a wheat field (annual crop), an\napple orchard (perennial crop with minimal tolerance for pest damage) and\nthe landscape (site with multiple plant species and higher tolerance to pests)\nwill be vastly different.\nIPM Strategies\nPlant Health Care, PHC\nThe term Plant Health Care, PHC, was coined by the International Society\nof Arboriculture to define IPM techniques as they apply to tree care and\nlandscape maintenance. You will often find the two terms (IPM and PHC)\nused interchangeably.\nPHC, like IPM, is a holistic approach, but specifically to tree and landscape\nmanagement. The primary objective is to grow healthy plants and minimize\nthe effects of pests in so doing. Concepts of PHC include the following:\n• \tHealthy plants have fewer pests. – Many insect and disease\nproblems only attack stressed plants. Minimizing stress prevents\nmany common pests. For example, Cytospora canker fungus and\nmost borers only attack stressed trees (from factors such as soil\ncompaction, drought, root damage and drought).\n• \tHealthy plants are more tolerant of pests. – For example, aphids\non shade trees generally do not warrant management efforts. An\nimportant exception is that trees that are water stressed (dry soils,\nnon-established root systems, limited root spread, etc.) are intolerant\nof aphid feeding.\n• \tLife cycle: Plant needs change with stages in their life cycle. – A\nplant’s needs for irrigation, fertilizer, pruning, tolerance to pests, etc.\ncontinually change through the growth cycles of the plant.\n• \tPIC cycle: Problems arise from a combination of stress factors.\n– For example, over-maturity of forests coupled with drought leads\nto bark beetles in Western pine forests. Soil compaction, drought\nand restricted rooting can lead to Cytospora canker disease.",

    "content": "101-3\nThe PIC Cycle A basic principle of PHC is recognition that plant problems generally arise\nfrom a combination of stress factors. This concept is called the PIC cycle.\nPredisposing factors reduce a plant’s tolerance to stress. These factors\nshould be considered in plant selection. Examples of predisposing\nfactors include:\no \tPlanting trees in a site where root spread will be restricted due to\nsoil compaction or hardscape features.\no \tPlanting trees intolerant of wet soils (like crabapples) in heavily\nirrigated lawns (leads to root rots).\no \tPlanting trees susceptible to iron chlorosis in soils with free lime.\no \tFailure to structurally train young trees (predisposing trees to\nstorm damage).\nInciting factors include primary insect, disease, and abiotic disorders that\nattack healthy plants, causing acute stress. Examples include:\no \tSoil compaction, the most common stress factor leading to many\ninsect and disease problems.\no \tPlanting trees too deep (leads to trunk girdling roots).\no \tDrought.\no \tLeaf chewing insects, such as caterpillars and sawfly larva.\no \tLeaf sucking insects, such as aphids and leafhoppers.\no \tBark damage from lawn mowers.\no \tBark cankers and frost cracks from rapid winter temperature\nchanges coupled with winter drought.\nContributing factors include secondary insect, disease, and abiotic\ndisorders that attack plants already stressed. They often lead to the\nplant’s death and frequently cannot be controlled. Examples\ninclude:\no \tBark beetles and borers (secondary to soil compaction, drought,\nand wind damage).\no \tCytospora fungus (secondary to soil compaction, drought, and\nrestricted rooting system).\no \tTrunk girdling roots caused by planting too deep.\nManagement of contributing factors typically needs to be\ndirected at the predisposing and inciting factors that stress the\nplant.\nIPM Techniques\nExamples of techniques used include the following:",

Correctly identifying the plant will shorten the\nlist of potential insects, diseases, and abiotic disorders.\n2. \tWhat is the disorder/pest? Correctly identifying the disorder/pest\nwill guide effective management options. Gardeners often fail to\ncontrol pests because they have misidentified the problems and are\napplying ineffective management techniques.\n3. \tWhat type of damage/stress does it cause? In the landscape\nsetting, most insect and disease problems are only cosmetic and may\nnot warrant management efforts. To protect plant health,\nmanagement may be needed on some pests. Fruits and vegetables\ntypically have low tolerance to insects and diseases.\n4. \tUnder what situations will management efforts be warranted?\nIn production agriculture, economic thresholds determine how\nmuch damage can be tolerated before it becomes economically\nfeasible to treat. For example, this may be determined by counting\nthe number of insects per leaf, the number of insects in a square foot\nof soil, or the percent of leaves infected.\nIn landscape horticulture, aesthetic thresholds characterize a\nrelative level of cosmetic damage that can be tolerated before\ntreatment is warranted. This threshold will vary considerably from\nindividual to individual and from location to location.\nSpider mites are an example of a common pest generally kept in\nbounds by nature. However management efforts may be warranted\nin situations where mite populations flare up due to hot weather,\ndrought, dust on plants (interferes with activity of beneficials) or the\nuse of some insecticides including imidacloprid (Merit) and carbaryl\n(Sevin).\n5. \tWhat management options are effective on the disorder/pest and\nwhen are they applied?\no \tWeather – While we cannot control the weather, it directly\ninfluences the occurrence of many insects and diseases\no \tCultural – Such as watering more or less",

For example, the description “leaves are\nyellow” is so general that nothing can be diagnosed without more details.\nA typical home gardener may say they have “black bugs”. What do they\nmean by “bug”? Are they saying they have a black insect? More details\nare needed to diagnose the problem.\nRead – Part of the diagnostic process is to read, comparing the symptoms and\nsigns of the problems with details in references. \tDo not simply work from\nmemory.\nReferring to multiple books or other refernces on the same topic gives a\nbetter understanding of a pests’ description and management situation. \tIn\ndiagnostic work, read for the details.\nAsk questions – Diagnosis requires extensive two-way conversations. Often the\nperson trying to diagnose the problem has not been on site and has to\ntotally rely on the descriptions of someone else. In this situation, diagnosis\nis difficult to impossible. Even with good samples or when visiting the\nsite, questions about the care of the plant, history of the site and\nprogression of symptoms are needed in the diagnostic process.",

    "content": "102-2\nPractice – Diagnostics is far more than applying knowledge that can be read in a\nbook. The diagnostic process requires the integration of years of\ngardening wisdom, knowledge and practice.\nPatience – Diagnosing plant disorders is a process, not a simple answer to a\nquestion. It takes time and patience to work the process. Never jump at an\nanswer just because it seems easy. Don’t guess. Take the time to work the\nprocess, asking lots of questions.\nIn pest management, first diagnose the problem and then discuss management\noptions. Because management options are very pest specific, correct diagnosis of\nthe problems must be completed before management can be discussed.\nAsking Questions and Gathering Information\nAsk questions that create dialogue. For example, “Tell me how you watered the\nplant.” Avoid accusatory type questions, (e.g., “Did you over water the plant?”)\nSome disorders cannot be diagnosed. – We can only complete a diagnosis when\ndetailed information is available. Descriptions, like “yellow leaves” or “poor\ngrowth” are inadequate descriptions for a diagnosis.\nDiagnosis must be done in the context of the plant’s environment. – For\nexample, is a tree in a routinely irrigated lawn or in a site with limited irrigation?\nDoes the site have an open area for root spread or is the root system limited by\npoor soils or hardscape features?\nFor example, a client calls with concerns that her tree looks wilted. Should she\nwater more? After asking questions, it is discovered that the tree is located in a\nconstruction site and had most of the root system cut. Understanding the context\nof the root damage is essential to addressing the watering issue.\nQuestions asked may not reflect the real issues. - In the diagnostic process,\nColorado Master Gardener volunteers must often help frame questions as well as\nprovide answers. For example, in the previous situation with the tree in the\nconstruction site, an important question is the stability of the tree with respect to\nwind as most of the roots have been cut.\nA useful tool in diagnosing trees is visualizing the plant, that is creating a\nmental picture of it and its surroundings. As you create the picture, ask questions\nabout details. Verify the details. Explain to the client that you are trying to create a\nmental picture of their plant problem will encourage them to more patiently\nprovide the needed information.\nWhen working with clients, repeat back their description in your own words.\nThis helps clear up miscommunications about symptoms.\nWhen working with clients, verbally explain how you rule out possible causes.\nThis helps the client move on with you and may clarify miscommunication about\nsymptoms.\nDiagnosis is not possible when general symptoms are all we have to work\nwith. Keep in mind that multiple problems can have similar symptoms.",

READ – Refer to reference materials describing similar signs and\nsymptoms.\ng. \tCOMPARE – Determine probable cause(s) through comparison and\nelimination.\nPart B: Management\n3. \tEVALUATE if management efforts are warranted.\na. \tWhat type of damage/stress does this disorder/pest cause?\nb. \tUnder what situations would management be warranted?\nc. \tIs management warranted in this situation?\n4. \tEvaluate management options effective for this disorder/pest and when\nthey are applied.\nStep 1 – Identify the Plant\nThere are hundreds of insects and diseases that attack plants in any geographic\nregion. Once the plant has been correctly identified, the list of potential insects\nand diseases that attack the specific plant drops to just a few. Additionally, insects\nand diseases account for only a small percent of landscape plant problems. When\nworking with abiotic disorders, plant identification will be helpful but will not\nshorten the list of potential possibilities as significantly.\nMany gardeners are not familiar with plant materials and need help to correctly\nidentify them. Identification is not practical over the phone. A branch sample with\nleaves attached should be brought to the Extension office or good photographs",

A detailed description of the\nproblem is essential for diagnosis. In situations where the description is limited or\nsymptoms are too general, diagnosis will be impossible. When diagnosing abiotic\ndisorders, systematically evaluating a plant will help organize questions.\nSymptoms are changes in the plant’s growth or appearance in response to\ncausal factors.\nSigns are the presence of the actual organism or direct evidence of the\ncasual factors.\nTime development – Knowing the time frame for the development of signs and\nsymptoms is a helpful tool. Did it occur suddenly or over a period of time? Keep\nin mind that the gardener may not actually know as he or she may not have\nobserved the early development. Symptoms that occur suddenly and do not\nprogress are typical of abiotic disorders. Symptoms that progressively develop are\ntypical of living factors (insects and diseases).\nKeep in mind that multiple problems have similar symptoms. Let the symptoms\nlead you to the diagnosis rather than trying to make a diagnosis fit a group of\nsymptoms.\nTerminology used to describe common symptoms includes:\n• \tBlight – A rapid discoloration and death of twigs, foliage or flowers.\n• \tCanker – Dead area on bark or stem, often sunken and discolored.\n• \tChlorosis – Yellowing.\n• \tDecline – Progressive decrease in plant vigor.\n• \tDieback – Progressive death of shoot, branch or root starting at the tip.\n• \tGall or gall-like – Abnormal localized swelling or enlargement of plant\npart. It could be caused by insects, mites, diseases or abiotic disorders.\n• \tGummosis – Exudation of gum or sap.\n• \tLeaf distortion – The leaf could be twisted, cupped, rolled or otherwise\ndeformed.\n• \tLeaf scorch – Browning along the leaf margin and into the leaf from the\nmargin.\n• \tLeaf spot – A spot or lesion on the leaf.\n• \tNecrosis – Dead tissue – additional details are needed.\n• \tWilt – General wilting of the plant or plant part.\n• \tWitches broom – Abnormal broom-like growth of many weak shoots.\nTerminology used to describe signs includes:\n• \tFruiting bodies – Reproductive structures of fungi; could be in the form\nof mushrooms, puffballs, pycnidia, rusts or conks.\n• \tInsects and mites",

A systematic evaluation of a\nplant will be helpful in diagnosing abiotic disorders. Abiotic disorders occur in\nabout 80% of the samples diagnosed by CSU Extension and often predispose the\nplant to insects and diseases.\nStep 3 – Evaluate If Management Efforts Are Warranted\nStep 3a – What Type of Damage/Stress Does This Disorder/Pest Cause?\nThe primary question here is to determine if the disorder/pest is only cosmetic, if it\nadds stress to a plant or if it is potentially life threatening. This may depend, in\npart, on the overall health of the plant before the disorder/pest started.\nStep 3b – Under What Situations Would Management Efforts be Warranted?\nMany insect and disease problems are only cosmetic on healthy, stress- free plants.\nHowever, stressed plants are much less tolerant.\nFor example, aphids feeding on shade trees are generally only cosmetic and\nnormally do not warrant management efforts unless they become a nuisance (like\ndripping honeydew on a car or patio table). However, under water stress, aphid\nfeeding increases the water needs of the tree creating a potentially serious stress\nissue. In this situation, mechanical (hosing off the tree with water), bionaturals\n(adding beneficials to feed on the aphids) or insecticidal management efforts\nwould be warranted to protect the tree.\nAs a rule-of-thumb for leaf chewing insects, healthy trees can tolerate the loss of\n1/3 of the total leaving surface before stress becomes a management issue.\nTolerance is much less for trees with growth limiting factors.\nEvergreens are much less tolerant because the needles last for multiple years. For\nexample, a sawfly larva outbreak that removes all the new needles would have an\ninfluence over multiple years; this would bring a healthy tree to a threshold where\nmanagement would be warranted.",

For example, hosing off\na plant with a strong force of water may be an effective mechanical option for\nsome insect pests. In other situations an insecticide may be needed.\nManagement efforts may take the approach of dealing with soil issues, such as\nlawn aeration to reduce soil compaction around a tree.\nOther management efforts may go in the direction of irrigating a dry site during hot\ndry weather or reducing over-watering with better irrigation system design and\nmanagement.\nManagement options include far more than just spraying an insecticide.

They grow\nrapidly and produce their edible portion in 25–100 days. We appreciate vegetables because\nthey are tender and crisp or have succulent fruits of various kinds. Plants grown under stress,\nlacking water and fertility are not as productive nor as desirable to the palate.\nBy following these guidelines you may be rewarded with a productive garden of\nquality vegetables without obtaining a soil test. If the soil has not been gardened previously,\nor if the garden performs poorly in spite of your fertility program, perhaps you should\nconsider a soil test. The USU Soil Testing Lab will test your soil for $10.00 and give you pH,\nphosphorus, lime potassium, soluble salts and soil texture readings. Other tests are also\navailable. For more information call 801-797-2217. The test will not identify soil home\ninsects, diseases or chemical residues.\nThe basis for fertilizer recommendations is different for gardens than for farm crops,\nsince the aim is to grow the best possible vegetable crops in the small space available. Your\ngoal should be to stimulate early growth and to accommodate the limited root system of a\nshort-season crop. Home vegetable gardens are not usually large. For a few dollars you can\npurchase enough fertilizer to be generous to an extent farmers wouldn’t consider. Don’t over\napply fertilizer, especially nitrogen and potassium, to avoid damage to roots by excessive salt\nbuild-up. Excess phosphorous reduces the availability of minor elements such as iron,\nmanganese, and zinc.\nWHAT DOES MY SOIL CONTAIN?\nMost native soils in our area contain rather high levels of potassium. Phosphorus\ncontent varies but availability is often low. After lawns, trees and gardens are indiscriminately\nfertilized for a few years, one or both of these elements may be excessively high. Factors such\nas soil alkalinity, temperature, organic matter content and microbial activity will influence\nwhether these elements are available to plants when they need them. Nitrogen is readily\nleached from soil and must be applied each year for high yields.",

    "content": "WHAT SHOULD I ADD?\nPlants require nitrogen in largest quantities. Phosphorus and potassium are vital for\nleaf, stem and root development but smaller amounts are needed.\nAll substances sold as fertilizers must have a guaranteed analysis. This analysis is\nexpressed as a percent plant food content. For example, a 16-16-8 fertilizer contains 16%\nnitrogen, 16% phosphate (P O ) and 8% potash (K O). Minor elements used by vegetables are\t2 5 2\nusually in adequate supply in our soils.\nThe fertilizer formula you use depends on what is available in your area. Bulk\npurchases in 40–50 pound bags may be more economical than small boxes of highly\nspecialized individual crop food. Many flowers will respond well to the application methods\nand rates given for vegetables. If kept dry, fertilizer quality does not deteriorate.\nWHEN IS IT NEEDED?\nCool weather reduces the nutrient uptake of elements, especially phosphorus and\npotassium. This means there should be adequate supplies of soluble plant food readily\navailable so the young plant will produce early, rapid growth for maximum yields.\nThe first 4-6 weeks is critical for phosphorus and potassium uptake. Nitrogen may be\nsupplied later in the season. Adding the other two elements later does little good since as the\nsoil warms, they are available in sufficient quantities.\nBAND APPLICATION\nA small quantity of soluble nutrients at planting time into which roots of young plants\ncan grow will encourage early vigorous growth.\nMake a trench 3 inches deep with the\ncorner of a hoe. Use to ½ cup of a fertilizer\nsuch as 16-16-8 per 10 ft. of row. Form the seed\nfurrow at the proper depth for the vegetable\napproximately 2 inches above and 2 inches to\nthe side of the fertilizer. Don’t permit the seeds\nto contact the fertilizer. Weeds between the\nrows won’t be encouraged so much with\nbanded fertilizer.\nTo fertilize a transplant, place 2–3 tablespoons of a fertilizer such as 16-16-8, 4 to 5\ninches deep with a trowel or shovel. About 2–3 inches away, make another hole and set the\nplant.\nFertilizer may be applied in “spots” for vegetables spaced widely apart. Plant\ncucumber or squash seed in a 6–8 inch circle around ¼ cup of fertilizer buried 3–4 inches\ndeep.\nWell rotted manure or compost also may be banded. Much larger amounts will be\nneeded than with commercial fertilizers.\nBROADCAST APPLICATION\nThis method is less efficient but faster to apply than banded fertilizer. Weeds between\nthe rows will receive just as much as the garden plants!",

Phosphorous\nshould be placed deeply enough to contact moist soil so as to be available to plant roots. It\nremains wherever placed in the soil. If you’ve added a lot of organic matter for soil\nimprovement, you’ll also need to supply 10 lbs. of ammonium sulfate per 1,000 sq. ft. for\neach 1 inch depth of sawdust, leaves, straw, etc.\nSIDE DRESSING DURING THE SEASON\nAbout a month after planting, supplemental nitrogen may be required as shown by\nplant’s pale green or yellow color. This may be supplied by ½ cup ammonium sulfate, cup\nammonium nitrate, or ¼ cup urea per 10 ft. of row. Repeat this application if corn, pole beans,\nor other long season crops show a need. Nitrogen will leach readily from well drained, sandy\nsoils. Apply one-half these amounts on a more frequent schedule.\nTomatoes may produce an excess of foliage and a shortage of ripe tomatoes if they\nreceive too much extra nitrogen.\nSimply scatter the fertilizer near the plants before a sprinkler irrigation. You don’t\nneed to dig it in. With flood irrigation, place the fertilizer along the furrow near the\n“shoulder” before turning in the water.\nWHAT ABOUT MANURE?\nManures, when available, may help raise soil nutrient levels. Their use is a good way\nto recycle “waste” products. They add to the organic matter content of the soil which\nimproves tilth and the ability to hold water and nutrients. They also could add weed problems.\nIt is virtually impossible to know the nutrient content of manures. Their source,\namount and type of straw or other bedding materials, and leaching by rains will all vary.\nPoultry manure that has not been exposed to rain contains the most nitrogen. Manure of this\ntype should be added at the rate of 100–150 lbs per 1,000 sq. ft. Weathered or very strawy\nsteer or horse manure may require up to 1,500 pounds per 1,000 sq. ft. In fact, some horse\nbedding may have so much straw or shavings that the manure doesn’t furnish enough nitrogen\nto decompose it. Ammonium sulfate, 10 lbs per 1,000 square feet per inch of added material\nwill supply that nitrogen. Manure is low in phosphorous, so add 4 lbs of treble super\nphosphate 0-45-0, or equivalent, in mixed fertilizer when manure is applied.\nConsidering some of the above factors, a judicious use of supplemental chemical\nfertilizers may insure gardening success if manures are of inadequate supply or quality.\nUtah State University is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Institution\nIssued in furtherance of Cooperative Extension work, Acts of May 8 and June 30, 1914, in cooperation with\nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture, Robert L.

One of the\nimportant decisions in crop production is deciding how much fertilizer you should apply. Fertilizer application\nfocuses on meeting the nutrient needs of the crop you’ll grow. Too much fertilizer and potential profits are reduced.\nToo little fertilizer and there is not enough production. To meet the nutrient needs and produce a profitable crop,\nyou’ll need to create a fertilizer plan.\nThis publication explores the process of creating a fertilizer plan. This includes spending some time understanding\nthe soil and the available nutrients within it. You’ll also learn about the available forms of fertilizer and the methods\nof applying them to the soil. Using the information collected from both the soil and the available fertilizer options,\nyou’ll begin to create a fertilizer plan for the farm. Creating a fertilizer plan also includes understanding what the\ncosts are and their impacts on farm revenue.\nMany factors go into fertilizer planning. Understanding the soil is the first consideration since this is where fertilizer\nwill be applied. The properties and characteristics of the soil in your field can greatly affect the types of fertilizers\nand application methods you will want to use. Soil tests and their results are important to knowing what nutrients\nare already present and if they are available to the intended crop. Soil characteristics and the availability of\nnutrients is crucial information as you start to think about the amount of nutrients needed overall.\nThe amount of nutrients needed is influenced by what the yield goals are and whether the soil needs to be built up\nor if nutrient needs should only consider crop removal rates. Finally, how these nutrients will be applied completes\nthe decision factors needed for a successful and profitable crop. You can use many types of fertilizer.

    "content": "2 | P a g e\nUnderstanding the Soil\nYou will get your plan started by understanding the soil\nthat you’re working with in the fields.\nSoil is made up of soil particles, air, and water. Ideally,\nsoil should be filled with 25% water and 25% air and the\nother 50% with soil particles (Figure 1). This maximizes\nthe availability of nutrients to roots and keeps a healthy\nenvironment for soil microbes that help with nutrient\nuptake.\nThe type of particles often varies by the amount of\nsand, silt, or clay (Figure 2). Depending on the amount\nof each type of particles you have in your soil, the ability\nto interact with nutrients will be different from field to field. Knowing the soil type helps you understand what\nfertilizer options and strategies are best. For more information on the soil types in your field, visit the United States\nDepartment of Agriculture Web Soil Survey (https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/App/HomePage.htm).\nThe chemical make-up of the soil also influences nutrient\navailability. Adequate amounts of water, air, and soil particles\nare necessary, but chemically balanced soil is as well. If soils\nare balanced, they have the optimal pH, and plant roots can freely take up nutrients. If soil pH is too high or too low, nutrients\nmay be present, but the plants are unable to access them.\nFigure 1. Ideal soil has 50% pore space and 50% water and\nair.\nFigure 2.

    "content": "3 | P a g e\nUse the pH scale to guide you toward that chemical balance and achieve ideal growing conditions for the intended\ncrop. The optimum pH level for corn, soybeans, and wheat is 6.5. pH at slightly below or above these levels is\nacceptable, but 6.5 is the desired target. A level of 6.5 is optimal for these crops because it allows them access to\nthose nutrients needed in larger quantities (Figure 3).\nDepending on the intended crop, the optimal levels may be different, such as blueberries that prefer a pH of 5.5. In\nthe case of most row crops, such as corn, soybeans, and wheat, a pH of 6.5 allows access to several important\nnutrients. This includes nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, calcium, and magnesium.\nTo identify soil characteristics and the available nutrients present, routine soil testing is necessary. Ideally, you\nshould test soil every three years. Soil tests tell where the pH levels are and help track them over time. If pH levels\nare low, a soil amendment called lime may be needed to bring pH back up to optimum levels. The Michigan State\nUniversity (MSU) Extension bulletin Lime for Michigan Soils (E-471)\n(https://www.canr.msu.edu/uploads/resources/pdfs/lime-for-mi-soils-e-471.pdf) provides guidance on using lime to\ncorrect pH levels.\nSoil tests also help to track the amount of nutrients available and if those levels are increasing or decreasing over\ntime. If nutrient levels are low, MSU Extension recommends using build-up rates of fertilizer to bring nutrient levels\nup to a more sufficient level. Once at a sufficient level, there is no agronomic reason to apply fertilizer. The goal is\nto maintain soil nutrients at optimal levels, where a yield response to fertilizer is not expected. At optimal levels, the\nonly fertilizer applied should be to recover what nutrients the crop will remove at harvest.\nTo understand the amount of nutrients to apply to the soil, consider the farm’s yield goals. Yield goals have several\ndetermining factors. They include the soil type, the cation exchange capacity (CEC) level, the availability of water\nthroughout the growing season, and the experience of the producer growing the crop.\nCation Exchange Capacity\nWhile all of these factors are important, the CEC is perhaps the\nmost important in determining a yield goal. CEC is a measure of\nthe soil’s ability to hold positively charged ions. All nutrients are\nmade up of ions. The ions with a positive charge are called\ncations and the ions with negative charges are called anions\n(Figure 4). Soils can readily hold cations, but they hold few\nanions. The higher the CEC level, the more positively charged\nnutrients, or cations, the soil can hold.\nFigure 4. All nutrients are made up of positively\nor negatively charged ions.",

    "content": "4 | P a g e\nThe soil’s structure and stability when growing a\ncrop influences the CEC. This is a concern in\nareas of severe weather. The CEC influences\nnutrient availability, pH levels, and even how the\nsoil will react to fertilizers. For example, an old\nstandby used by producers is to take the CEC\nlevel and multiply by two, giving an indication of\nthe nitrogen holding capacity of the soil.\nConsider the types of nitrogen fertilizers that can\nbe applied to the soil (Table 1). Ammonium\nsulfate and anhydrous ammonia contain\nammonium ions, which are positively charged\ncations. The soil can hold on to these nutrients for\na longer period of time without the immediate\nconcern of nutrient leaching. Nutrient leach is the\ndownward movement of dissolved nutrients in the\nsoil with gradually moving water.\nOn the other hand, nitrogen fertilizers such as\nurea ammonium nitrate (UAN) are mostly made\nup of nitrate ions, which are negatively charged anions. The soil does not hold on to anions for a significant\namount of time, leading to more concerns of nutrient leaching with these types of products.\nThe CEC is also an indicator of the soils ability to hold water. Water, or H 20, is made up of ions, too. Soils with\nhigher amounts of silt and clay have higher CEC levels than sandy soils, so they can hold on to larger amounts of\nwater and nutrients. The higher the CEC levels, the greater amount of water-holding capacity the soils have.\nTypically, CEC levels of 11 to 50 retain more water than levels below 11.\nRate of Nutrients to Apply\nEquipped with the soil’s ability to hold on to water and nutrients, as well as soil test results for the farm, the next\nconsideration is the rate of nutrients to apply. There are several methods of determining nutrient amounts to apply,\nincluding build-up and maintenance or nutrient removal only. Another option is the Marginal Return to Nitrogen\n(MRTN) method that combines nutrient needs and economics. For more information on the MRTN method, review\nthe MSU Extension article “Corn Nitrogen Recommendations”\n(https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/corn_nitrogen_recommendations).\nA build-up and maintenance approach involves applying enough fertilizer to keep the soil at healthy levels. The\napplication of nutrients will meet the farm’s yield goals, but often requires more fertilizer than focusing only on\nnutrient removal. However, if soil levels are high enough, this method can apply amounts less than nutrient\nremoval.\nTable 1. Nutrients are either positively charged cations or negatively\ncharged anions.",

Table 2 is adapted from the MSU Extension\nbulletin Nutrient Recommendations for Field Crops in\nMichigan (E-2904) (https://soils.msu.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2014/06/MSU-Nutrient-recomdns-\nfield-crops-E-2904.pdf). It highlights that crop\nremoval depends on how many bushels or tons will\nbe removed from the field. Each bushel or ton\nremoves a certain amount of nutrients. The more\nbushels or tons produced, the more nutrients will be\nremoved.\nSince production numbers won’t be known until\nharvest, you’ll need to finalize the farm’s yield goal to\nfully use the table as part of your fertilizer planning.\nLook at an example using a field of corn.\nTo find the amount of nutrients that will need to be replaced, you will need to calculate the yield goal for the corn\ncrop. This means locating information on the soil type, the CEC level, the availability of water throughout the\ngrowing season, and the experience of the producer growing the crop.\nExample Corn Farm\nSoil Type: \tSandy Loam\nCation Exchange Capacity (CEC) Level: \t5\nAvailability to Water: \tNo irrigation – dryland field\nGrower Experience: \t10 years of raising corn\nExpected Yield Goal: 150 bushels per acre\nTable 3. Example Corn Farm.\nInformation on the example farm in Table 3 reveals that the field has a soil type of sandy loam and CEC levels\nfrom the soil test results are below 11. These results indicate there is not a great deal of water or nutrient-holding\ncapacity in the soil. The field is also considered “dryland” as it does not have an irrigation system, which means its\navailability to water is dependent solely on rainfall. Lastly, the producer has roughly 10 years of experience raising\ncorn and understands how it reacts in this type of environment. The producer calculates an expected yield goal of\n150 bushels per acre for this example farm.\nTable 2 (the previous nutrient removal chart) shows that every bushel expected at harvest will remove 0.9 lbs. of\nnitrogen, 0.37 lbs. of phosphorus, and 0.27 lbs. of potassium. Those nutrient removal values should be multiplied\nby the yield goal of 150 bushels. This results in 135 lbs. of nitrogen, 55 lbs. of phosphorus, and 40 lbs. of\npotassium that will need to be replaced per acre to maintain the soil at current nutrient levels.\nThe fertilizer needs of this example corn crop have been identified. The next step is to consider how those nutrient\nneeds can be met. Continue exploring the fertilizer planning process by looking at fertilizer options.\nFertilizer Options\nMany sources of fertilizer are available to producers. These sources often include organic and inorganic forms.\nTwo main sources are manure and commercial products.\nTable 2. Nutrient removal in harvested portions of several\nMichigan field crops.\nSource: Adapted from “Table 3. Nutrient Removal in Harvested Portions\nof Several Michigan Field Crops” in Warncke, D., Dahl, J., & Jacobs, L.\n(2009).

The amount of\nnutrients within manure can vary by the livestock source, whether that source is from a dairy, beef, poultry, or even\na swine operation. It can also vary by the nutrient content of the feed being fed to those sources. Dairy cows being\nfed certain feed mixes or rations can have significantly different amounts of nutrients available in their manure\ncompared with dairy cows receiving other feed mixes or rations.\nTest manure samples to determine accurate nutrient levels before applying manure to any fields. The remaining\nnutrients not provided in the manure can then be met using commercial products.\nCommercial products often have a greater availability\nthan that of manure. There is also more uniformity in\napplication as nutrient levels tend to remain relatively\nthe same from one load to the next. However,\ncommercial products are typically more expensive than\nmanure alternatives. These considerations keep both\noptions viable to producers depending on their situation.\nManure is highly regulated within Michigan because of\nthe concern of overapplication and the desire to\nmaintain safe levels of phosphorus in the soil.\nTo apply manure, you should follow the Generally\nAccepted Agricultural and Management Practices\nguidelines (GAAMPs) from the Michigan Right to Farm\nprogram (https://www.michigan.gov/mdard/0,4610,7-\n125-1599_1605---,00.html). These guidelines use the\nfield’s soil tests to determine how much manure can be\napplied to a field (Figure 5).\nIf soil phosphorus levels are higher than 150 ppm\n(equivalent to 300 lbs.), you will need to draw down the nutrient levels before you apply more manure. If the test\nlevels are below 75 ppm, you can apply manure to supply all crop nutrient needs.\nIf test levels show phosphorus is between 75 and 150 ppm, you can apply crop removal or maintenance amounts\neach year. However, while applications each year are an option, doing so is often impractical. One load of manure\ntypically carries more than one year’s worth of crop removal. In an effort to recognize this, up to four years’ worth\nof crop removal can be applied at one time. Afterward, you’ll have to wait those four years before re-applying.\nCommercial Products\nCommercial products are regulated by state and federal laws as well. These products are required to display their\nnutrient content within their label.\nAt least three numbers are associated with the nutrient content in a label. The first number is the amount of\nnitrogen in the product; the second number, the phosphorus amount; and the third number, the potassium amount.\nThis is often referred to as the NPK ratio and indicates the percentage of each nutrient regardless of whether the\nproduct is in a dry or liquid formulation. Nutrient ratios that have more than the NPK will always include the number\nand the letter corresponding to the nutrient such as the 17% sulfur included with potassium thiosulfate.\nFigure 5. Soil test levels help determine how much manure\ncan be applied to a field.",

    "content": "7 | P a g e\nWith dry products, determining the amount of nutrients being\npurchased is relatively easy to calculate. Diammonium\nphosphate (DAP) contains 18% nitrogen and 46% phosphorus\nin the form of P2O 5 (Figure 6).\nUsing 100 lbs. of this product contains 46 lbs. of P2O 5. In that\nsame 100 lbs., you will also receive 18 lbs. of nitrogen.\nHow does this convert to tons if you are purchasing a ton of this\nproduct? A ton equals 2,000 lbs., therefore 46% of one ton of\nDAP contains 920 lbs. of P2 O 5. A ton also contains 18% or 360\nlbs. of nitrogen.\nFor a liquid product, the focus is on gallons per acre being applied. This requires more math than using dry\nproducts because tons must be converted to gallons. To convert tons into gallons, the density of the product is a\nfactor. Density refers to how much a gallon of the product weighs.\nIn the case of ammonium polyphosphate, or 10-34-0, each gallon\nweighs 11.7 lbs. The label indicates that for every pound there is 34%\nphosphorus in the form of P2O 5. Multiplying 11.7 by 34% reveals that in\nevery gallon of 10-34-0, there are 3.98 lbs. of P2O 5 .\nAmmonium polyphosphate also contains 10% nitrogen. Using the\nsame density weight of 11.7 lbs. and multiplying it by 10%, each gallon\nof the product contains 1.17 lbs. of nitrogen (Figure 7).\nThis product may also be purchased in tons. One ton contains 171 gallons (2000 lbs. ÷ 11.7 lbs. = 171 gallons) of\nproduct. If one gallon has 3.98 lbs. of P2O 5, then 171 gallons will have 680 lbs. of P2O 5 (3.98 lbs. x 171 gallons).\nOne gallon also has 1.17 lbs. of nitrogen or 200 lbs. in one ton.\nFertilizer Application Timing\nThe next consideration is how the fertilizer products will be applied. With most field crops, there are three main\napplication periods: pre-plant, at the time of planting, or post-emergence.\nThe pre-planting period occurs before the seeds are planted in the soil.\nTypically, fertilizer is applied through broadcast spreading,\nincorporation into the soil, or both. Incorporation can be by tillage\nfollowing broadcast or through injection.\nThe second method occurs at the time of planting, typically through the\nplanter and often referred to as starter. The use of the term starter\ncomes from the planter placing the fertilizer close to the seed. The\nplacement of the fertilizer encourages more rapid and uniform growth in\nthe field as the plant “starts” out (Figure 8).\nThe last method is post-emergence, which occurs after the plants have\nemerged from the soil. This is accomplished by either broadcasting,\nspraying with pesticides, “Y” drops, or incorporation. These are often\nreferred to as side-dress applications (Figure 9).\nFigure 6. Label of diammonium phosphate.\nFigure 7. Label of ammonium polyphosphate.\nFigure 8. Planters apply fertilizer close to the\nseed to encourage uniform growth.",

If all fertilizer is applied at pre-plant, it may be too\nearly for the crop to fully utilize. For example, there is a risk that fertilizer\nmay leach or not be as readily available later in the season.\nAlternatively, if all fertilizer is applied at post-emergence, the crop may\nnot grow uniformly during the season prior to the application. The crop\ncould also suffer through nutrient deficiencies before the fertilizer is\napplied. Therefore, the costs of application timing can be just as\nimpactful as the types of fertilizer being applied.\nConsider an example where 250 lbs. of nitrogen are applied at planting.\nNitrogen leaching causes 30% or 75 lbs. of lost nutrients over the\ncourse of the season. If these nutrients are valued at $0.55 per pound\nand multiplied by 75 lbs., then the loss to leaching is $42 per acre. In\naddition to the lost dollars per acre, a significant amount of nutrients is\nnot available when the plant needs them later in the season.\nRisks of nutrient availability and deficiencies are minimized by splitting the applications over multiple periods. This\nis especially important for sandy soils with lower CEC levels due to their lower nutrient-holding capacity. Some\nproducers also make use of nitrogen stabilizers to extend the availability of nutrients in season. For more\ninformation on stabilizer products, review University of Nebraska–Lincoln’s Crop Watch article “Nitrogen Fertilizer\nStabilizers in Corn” (https://cropwatch.unl.edu/2018/nitrogen-fertilizer-stabilizers-corn).\nType of Fertilizer Products to Apply\nDeciding which type of products to use depends on the type of equipment, amount of available labor hours, and\ncost of nutrient products per application. For example, if your farm’s equipment is set up for dry fertilizer products,\nthe use of any liquid products will require the purchase of new equipment or hiring of a custom applicator. Single-\noperator farms with no employees have a limited amount of time that they can spend on applications. This often\nrequires custom hiring to assist in fertilizer applications and can present opportunities for both liquid and dry\nproducts to be used. These opportunities also extend to spreading of manure, especially if the farm does not own\nany livestock.\nCreating a Fertilizer Plan\nEverything to this point has been about understanding the components needed to create a fertilizer plan. Now it’s\ntime to take that information and begin building the plan for your farm.\nTo help you think about this process, continue with the example corn farm with a yield goal of 150 bushels per\nacre. Imagine that the soil test information indicates that the farm should focus on covering the crop removal\namounts. Table 2 showed the farm will need 135 lbs. of nitrogen, 55 lbs. of phosphorus, and 40 lbs. of potassium.\nThese nutrient amounts maintain the soil at current levels and meet the yield goal.\nFertilizer Plan (Dry Products Only)\nTo apply crop removal needs using only dry products, first calculate phosphorus needs. Some fertilizer products\ncontaining phosphorus may also contain other nutrients, such as nitrogen. For example, diammonium phosphate\n(DAP) contains both phosphorus and nitrogen. When calculating how much of this product to use for phosphorus,\na portion of nitrogen needs may be covered as well.\nFigure 9. Incorporating fertilizer after plants\nemerge is often called side-dress.\n\"Applying Anhydrous Ammonia\" by Macomb\nPaynes is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 .",

Amount of diammonium phosphate to apply.\nNow, consider the nitrogen being applied with the same product. There are 120 lbs. being applied so how should\nnitrogen be considered? First, because of the concern of leaching over time, it is important to determine if the\ntiming of the application will make the nitrogen available to the crop. If nitrogen will not be available, then it should\nnot be counted toward meeting the yield goal. This is true of any nutrient that has a concern of leaching.\nIn this example, consider that all nutrients can be utilized and counted toward the yield goal. Since DAP contains\n18% nitrogen in every pound, the farm is receiving 22 lbs. of nitrogen in the 120 lbs. being applied (Equation 2).\n18-46-0 Applied \t% Nitrogen \tCalculation \tNitrogen Applied\n120 lbs. \t18% \t120 x 0.18 \t22 lbs.\nEquation 2. Amount of nitrogen in diammonium phosphate being applied.\nThose 22 lbs. can be subtracted from the overall nitrogen needs of 135 lbs. to leave 113 lbs. remaining. To apply\nthe remaining 113 lbs. of nitrogen, the farm will be using urea. Urea is 46% nitrogen, which means every 100 lbs.\nof the product contains 46 lbs. of nitrogen. To find the urea amount to apply, divide 113 lbs. by 46%. This\ncalculation reveals that 246 lbs. of urea are needed to reach the 150 bushels per acre yield goal (Equation 3).\nN needs \t% N in Urea \tCalculation \tUrea to Apply\n113 lbs. \t46% \t113/0.46 \t246 lbs.\nEquation 3. Amount of urea to apply.\nNow, consider potassium needs. The yield goal indicates that 40 lbs. of K2O will be needed. Potassium chloride, or\npotash, will be used to achieve this goal. Potash or 0-0-60 contains 60% K2O in every pound of the product, which\nmeans that for every 100 lbs., there are 60 lbs. of K2O. Divide 40 lbs. by 60% and the results reveal that 67 lbs. of\npotassium chloride should be applied (Equation 4).\nK 20 needs \t% K 20 in Potash \tCalculation \tPotash to Apply\n40 lbs. \t60% \t40/0.60 \t67 lbs.\nEquation 4. Amount of potassium chloride (potash) to apply.\nRemember that the methods used to apply these products will vary depending on equipment and timing available\nto the individual producer. The key is that the methods used should apply the nutrients at a time when they will\nbenefit the crop. As discussed earlier, if you are applying a product such as diammonium phosphate in a pre-plant\nsituation, you need to consider whether the nitrogen being applied will be of any benefit to the crop. In which case,\nyou may want to re-evaluate which products to use to meet your nitrogen needs.\nFertilizer Plan (Liquid Products Only)\nA fertilizer plan using dry products only was just developed. Now, consider using only liquid products and the same\nexample of corn crop. Again, the farm needs to meet the nutrient removal amounts to reach its yield goal of 150\nbushels per acre.",

As mentioned earlier, liquid products focus on an application rate of gallons per acre, which\nmeans the density of the product is a factor.\nFor 10-34-0, the density is 11.7 lbs. per gallon and there is 34% of P2O 5 in every pound. Therefore, one gallon of\n10-34-0 contains 3.98 lbs. of P2O 5. You will need 55 lbs. of P2O 5 applied to the soil.

A number\nof dry and liquid products can meet crop removal needs for your farm. Each offers their own sets of advantages\nand disadvantages.\nAdvantages & Disadvantages of Fertilizer Products\nDry products offer a higher versatility to mix and fine-tune applications, so more nutrients can be provided per\napplication and reduce costs. Liquid products can be mixed but often require specific mixing directions to avoid\nchemical reactions that can be damaging to the crop. Dry products are often cheaper on a per acre basis.\nHowever, liquid products have their own advantages. Plants prefer nutrients in forms that are easier to use.\nNutrients in liquid products are typically in these desired forms, whereas many dry products require\nmicroorganisms to convert the nutrients. This helps to explain why liquid products are often used to correct nutrient\ndeficiencies. They are taken up by the plant more quickly, which reduces potential yield loss. Liquid products are\nalso easier to handle as they are less bulky and can be easily stored or transported in containers.\nMost fertilizer plans use a mixture of liquid and dry products to reduce costs and maximize the benefits that each\ntype of product offers. To illustrate this, consider the costs of fertilizer planning.\nCosts of a Fertilizer Plan\nIdentifying the costs of a fertilizer plan involve several factors. These can include the cost of labor, fertilizer\nproducts, and product application. The cost of the products themselves tend to be the most variable, while costs\nfor labor and product application are relatively more uniform across acres. Wages per hour for employees typically\nremain the same and applicators hired for custom work tend to charge a standard rate per acre. For more\ninformation on these custom rates, view the MSU Custom Machine and Work Rate Estimates factsheet at\nhttps://www.canr.msu.edu/resources/custom-machine-work-costs.\nManure costs will vary based on the source and the nutrient content expected from that source. The costs of\ncommercial products can vary between the quantity of product purchased and the amount paid for them. Dry\nproducts are typically sold in tons, while liquid products can be sold in tons or by the gallon. A comparison of costs\nat each product’s application rates helps to determine which is more or less expensive.",

There are 171 gallons\nper ton of this product. This means each gallon will cost $2.66.\nThe cost of those 14 gallons is $37.25 per acre (Equation 15).\nLastly, look at the potassium needs using\npotassium thiosulfate. The farm is applying\n13 gallons at a cost of $630 per ton. Using\nthe density factor of 12.2 pounds per gallon,\nthere are 164 gallons in each ton of this\nproduct. Dividing the price of $630 per ton by 164 gallons results in a cost of\n$3.84 per gallon. Multiply the 13 gallons by $3.84. This equals a per acre cost\nof $49.94 (Equation 16).\nAdding these costs together, using only liquid\nproducts will cost $139.59 per acre (Equation\n17).\nHow does the cost of the fertilizer plan affect the overall revenue for the farm?\nThe expected revenue remains the same as the previous example with only dry\nproducts.

These additional costs of seed,\nchemicals, and land rent remain the same from\nthe dry products example (Table 5).\nThe same questions from the dry products\nexample are also asked. Is $86 a reasonable\namount to cover repairs, fuel, insurance, and\nany overhead costs that remain?\nIs enough revenue remaining to cover costs of\nfamily living, real estate taxes, or debt?\nAs you consider the cost of these fertilizer\nplans, recall that using only dry products will cost $94.09 per acre. In comparison, only using liquid products will\ncost $139.59 per acre. This is a difference of $45.50 per acre between the two example plans.\nThis difference helps to illustrate why producers seek to use a mixture of both dry and liquid products. As the\nbenefits of each product are considered, some nutrients can best be provided using dry products, while other\nnutrients by liquid products. By using both types of products, the cost of the fertilizer plan begins to shift\nsomewhere between these two values and erode away the $45.50 per acre difference in the examples. Find the\nright combination of products that will meet the nutrient needs at the lowest possible cost to your farm.\nBreak-Evens of Fertilizer Plan\nAnother way to view the cost of these fertilizer plans is to consider them in a break-even position. The following\nfocuses on a break-even for price and a break-even for yield.\nFor the dry products, divide the cost of the plan by the yield goal of 150 bushels. This calculates a value of $0.63\nper bushel needed to cover costs. Alternatively, if the farm considers a market price of $3.50 per bushel, it will\nneed to sell 26.88 bushels at that price to cover the costs (Equation 18).\nCost of Plan Yield Goal or\nMarket Price Calculation \tBreak-Even\nPrice \t$94.09/acre \t150 bushels \t$94.09/150 \t$0.63/bushel\nYield \t$94.09/acre \t$3.50/bushel \t$94.09/$3.50 \t26.88 bushels\nEquation 18. Break-evens of price and yield for fertilizer plan (dry only).\nFor the liquid products, again look at both price and yield break-evens. For the price break-even, $0.93 per bushel\nis needed to cover costs. For break-even yield, the farm will need to sell 39.88 bushels to cover the costs\n(Equation 19).\nCost of Plan Yield Goal or\nMarket Price Calculation \tBreak-Even\nPrice \t$139.59/acre \t150 bushels \t$139.59/150 \t$0.93/bushel\nYield \t$139.59/acre \t$3.50/bushel \t$139.59/$3.50 \t39.88 bushels\nEquation 19.

    "content": "15 | P a g e\nTake a closer look at the break-evens for both fertilizer plans. First, consider the break-even price and the $0.30\ndifference between dry and liquid programs (Table 6). Understanding this comparison is where your role as a farm\nmanager becomes important. As you think back to the advantages of liquid products, is $0.30 an acceptable cost\nfor the benefits it offers? Or does the cost of the plan outweigh the benefits?\nCost of Plan \tYield Goal \tCalculation \tBreak-Even\nPrice \t$94.09/acre \t150 bushels \t$94.09/150 \t$0.63/bushel\nPrice \t$139.59/acre \t150 bushels \t$139.59/150 \t$0.93/bushel\nTable 6. Break-even price comparison of dry and liquid fertilizer plans.\nConsider the same questions in relation to the farm’s overall break-even. Does your answer change if the farm is\nusing only dry products and its overall break-even is $3.40? If the market outlook is estimating $3.50 per bushel,\nhow impactful would a change to only liquid products and increased costs of $0.30 per bushel be to the operation?\nUse a similar thought process with break-even yield. In comparison, the dry fertilizer plan will need 13 bushels less\nthan the liquid program to cover costs (Table 7). With the advantages and disadvantages of dry products in mind,\nwould saving the revenue of 13 bushels for other costs be best?\nCost of Plan \tMarket Price \tCalculation \tBreak-Even\nYield \t$94.09/acre \t$3.50/bushel \t$94.09/$3.50 \t26.88 bushels\nYield \t$139.59/acre \t$3.50/bushel \t$139.59/$3.50 \t39.88 bushels\nTable 7. Break-even yield comparison of dry and liquid fertilizer plans.\nDoes your answer change if production challenges (weather, available labor) are a concern?\nLooking at break-evens for both price and yield illustrate the importance of understanding how much more a\nfertilizer plan will need from the marketing and production activities on the farm. By mixing both dry and liquid\nproducts in a plan, the extra burden on marketing and production activities is often reduced. These activities can\ninclude the extra cost of equipment or the need to outsource applications.\nAs you think about fertilizer planning, remember that detailed planning can help reduce the impacts to revenue.\nYou can accomplish this by relying on accurate, routine soil testing to identify what nutrients are already present in\nthe soil. Taking advantage of those available nutrients can reduce the amount of fertilizer to apply and still ensure\nthat the plan meets your intended yield goals.\nMost importantly, a detailed fertilizer plan helps to meet the nutrient needs of your crop at the lowest possible cost.",

Seg-\nregate different types of symptoms into different samples.\nCollect several plant specimens\nA single plant sample may not be enough to allow a cor-\nrect diagnosis of the problem; several plant samples\nshowing the range of symptoms may be needed. If pos-\nsible, select samples with various stages of disease de-\nvelopment (early and late stages). Samples should be as\ntypical or representative of the overall problem as pos-\nsible. The best plant tissues for diagnosis are the ones\nshowing the symptoms in various stages of disease de-\nvelopment, and adequate amounts of them are impor-\ntant, but submitting excessive amounts of leaves or soil\nshould be avoided.\nDo not collect dead plants or plant organs\nDead plants or plant organs may not be useful for diag-\nnosis.

For example, some\nleaf symptoms of disease (wilting, for example) are the\nresult of damaged or diseased roots that have rotted and\nare no longer functioning to support the plant; in such\ncases, a correct diagnosis often depends on having a\nsample of the roots. Plants should be carefully dug from\nthe ground (not pulled out) so the root systems remain\nrelatively intact. When the entire plant cannot be\nsampled, shipped, or submitted, collect the largest plant\nsample possible, or portions of each major plant organ\n(roots, stems, leaves, flowers). Branch specimens should\ninclude the diseased area and part of the healthy area\nand may be at least 8–12 inches long. Be sure that root\nsamples are from the affected plants and not from adja-\ncent weeds. If entire plants cannot be sampled, submit\nphotographs of affected plants where possible.\nProvide as much background and related\ninformation as possible\nGood information contributes to a better understanding\nof the problem. A complete description of the problem\nand the crop’s history should accompany the sample.\nGive the name of the plant submitted. Indicate when the\nproblem appeared and when the sample was taken.\nSpecify all fertilizers and pesticides used. Examine the\ngrowing site carefully and note the conditions. Make\nnote of environmental conditions for the site such as\nelevation, flooding, previous crop history, etc. Indicate\nany observable pattern of disease occurrence (for ex-\nample, in random patches, or uniformly throughout the\ncrop). Review the worksheet on p. 7 (which is based on\nADSC’s Form 357) for information required. This infor-\nmation is helpful in making a distinction between dam-\nage caused by pests and damage caused by other factors.\nPreserving plant samples\nAfter collecting the samples, do not expose them to di-\nrect sunlight. Keep them cool and do not allow them to\ndry out or cook. Place samples in plastic bags in the\nshade or in a cooler until they are ready for delivery to\nthe plant clinic. Leaves may be pressed between the\npages of a book or magazine or wrapped in tissue.\nCollecting insect samples\nA good insect sample consists of a range of the\norganism’s life stages, if possible, presented in well pre-\nserved, undamaged condition. Following are general\nguidelines for collecting insect samples.\nAvoid touching insects with fingers\nSome insects can injure humans. Handling insects can\nalso cause damage to their bodies that may prevent their\nidentification.\nCollect different life stages of the insect\nSometimes insects cannot be properly identified unless\na certain life stage is present. For example, adults may\nbe needed for correct identification.\nCollect multiple specimens\nCollect several specimens of the insect.\nTime of day matters\nMany leaf-feeding insects (such as caterpillars) may hide\nfrom predators during daylight hours. It may be neces-\nsary to capture insects during twilight in the evening or\nearly morning.\nPreserving insect specimens\nMost insects: Roaches, termites, bugs, beetles, flies,\nwasps, ants, maggots, spiders, etc. should be immersed\nin isopropyl (“rubbing”) alcohol, which kills and pre-\nserves them.\nMites, scales, aphids, thrips: Send these in alive on\nsome of the affected foliage or stems, collected as\nyou would a plant specimen. Place in a plastic bag\nwhen collected. Refrigerate until sent.\nButterflies and moths: Kill the specimens by freezing,\nwrap lightly in tissue paper, and place in a crush-proof\nbox. Careful handling is required because the pattern\nof scale coloration is often used in identification.\nCaterpillars: Send in alive on some of the host plant\ntissues in a plastic bag. Refrigerate until sent.\nGrubs: Send in alive in a pint or two of soil enclosed in\na plastic bag. Refrigerate until sent.",

However, fleshy fruits, vegetables, or\ntubers in stages of decay should be wrapped individu-\nally in dry newspaper.\nDo not add extra water\nDo not add any water or moist paper towels. Moisture\nfavors the growth of fungi and bacteria that decay plant\ntissues, which can confuse or obscure the diagnosis of\nthe pathogen.\nLabel the samples\nWrite your name, telephone number, and name of the\nplant or sample number on the plastic bag, using an in-\ndelible marker. Or, write the information on a piece of\npaper and insert in the bag.\nSegregate plant tissue and insects from soil\nKeep soil off the foliage. Avoid contact of plant or in-\nsect samples and information labels with any soil that\nmight be in the plastic bag (unless it is a soil-dwelling\ninsect).\nTie off the root ball\nPlace the root system and accompanying soil in a plas-\ntic bag and tie it securely to the lower stem of the plant.\nThis will prevent roots from drying out and will keep\nthe soil secure. Place a second plastic bag over the\naboveground part of the plant, if possible, to prevent it\nfrom drying out.\nSubmit samples as soon as possible\nDecayed plant or insect samples are useless for an accu-\nrate disease diagnosis. Always plan to have samples ar-\nrive at the ADSC within one or two days of their collec-\ntion, if possible, or take steps to inhibit the deterioration\nor decay of samples (i.e., by refrigeration).\nSubmitting samples\nThe UH-CTAHR Agricultural Diagnostic Service Cen-\nter (ADSC) analyzes soils, plant tissues, and forages and\nidentifies plant pests and pathogens, for a fee. The ser-\nvices are itemized on the Web at www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/\nadsc.\nSamples of plants and insects may be hand-deliv-\nered or mailed to the nearest ADSC or Cooperative Ex-\ntension Service (CES) office. Because samples submit-\nted to CES offices have to be transported to ADSC for\ndiagnosis, contact the CES office to determine which\nday of the week is the best to submit samples. Commer-\ncial operations with large numbers of samples for diag-\nnosis (for example, for virus assay), are requested to\ncontact ADSC in advance before submitting the samples\nso that ADSC staff will be ready to handle the request.\nAt the time of submission, clients are asked to fill\nout a form describing the sample. The form asks about\nplant parts affected and plant symptoms and is similar\nto the check-off lists on p. 6.\nSamples are processed in the order they are received.\nDiagnosis is mailed to each client as soon as the work is\ncompleted. The CES offices can provide information on\nthe ADSC fee schedule.\nSpecial sampling considerations\nTurf\nSamples should be at least a 6” x 6” piece of the turf,\nincluding both root system and soil. If using a golf course\ncup cutter, please send at least two plugs. Collect samples\nfrom the border between healthy and diseased turf, so\nthat about two thirds of the sample is diseased turf and\none third of the sample is healthy-looking turf. Wrap\nthe soil and roots in aluminum foil to keep the soil from\nshaking loose during transit, and place it in a plastic bag.\nDo not expose samples to direct sunlight or high tem-\nperatures. Fill out the sample submission form com-\npletely, making sure to list all fertilizer, herbicide, fun-\ngicide, and insecticide applications made in the last 30\ndays, as well as any major cultural practices (aerification,\ntopdressing, etc.).\nWoody plants\n(This includes trees, landscape shrubs, vines, etc.)\nDieback: Collect a large handful of feeder roots and\none quart of soil from the root zone of plants that have",

Place roots and soil together in a\nplastic bag and close it securely. Place several branches\nshowing decline or dieback in a separate plastic bag.\nFor smaller plants, submit an entire plant (confine the\nroot ball in a plastic bag tied tightly to the stem). Place\nthe entire plant in another plastic bag and close it se-\ncurely. Be sure there is no water on the foliage surfaces\n(this causes deterioration during shipping).\nCanker, swellings on trees or shrubs: Cut the branch\nseveral inches beyond each end of the affected area, in-\ncluding some live wood. Place the specimen in a plastic\nbag and secure the bag.\nGreenhouse plants\nSubmit plants in their original pots whenever possible.\nPlant foliage should be dry, and the planting medium\nshould be slightly moist but not soggy. Place the pot in a\nplastic bag and tie it securely to the stem above the col-\nlar to prevent spilling during transport. Wrap the foliage\ngently in newspaper, and enclose the entire plant and\npot in a plastic bag.\nFleshy vegetables, fruits, mushrooms, harvested\nroot crops\nDo not place produce in plastic bags. Wrap each speci-\nmen in several layers of newspaper. Wrapped specimens\ncan be placed in paper bags. Collect several specimens.\nPackage the specimens in a box to prevent them from\nbeing crushed. Avoid exposure to high temperatures or\ndirect sunlight.\nSmall plants from fields, landscapes, or gardens\nDig up (do not pull) several complete plants, leaving\nsoil and roots intact. Enclose the roots and soil (approxi-\nmately one quart) in a plastic bag and secure the bag.\nPlace the entire plant in another plastic bag and secure\nit. Keep soil off of foliage.\nNematodes\nNematodes are associated with plant roots and soil.\nSamples should consist of both soil and the roots of the\naffected plant (do not collect weed roots) collected at 6”\ndepth. For large fields, collect multiple samples from a\nlarge area, bulk them together in a bucket, mix them\ntogether, and remove a representative subsample con-\nsisting of about of 2 pints of soil with roots. Place the\nsample in a plastic bag and keep it cool and away from\ndirect sunlight.\nFoliar nematodes\nIn wet environments, nematodes can invade and rot\nleaves, stems, buds, and flowers. These plant tissues\nshould be collected, wrapped in tissue to prevent dam-\nage to the specimens, and placed in plastic bags.",

However, we have learned that plants\nrespond to some fertilizers in ways which we may\nconsider desirable, such as by growing faster or\nimproving appearance. The usefulness of these\nfertilization outcomes is subjective. For example,\nfaster growth may be desired in one circumstance but\nmay lead to unwanted pruning in another. Improved\nappearance is important to some and unimportant to\nothers.\nThus the reason for fertilizing plants should be to\nsupply nutrients to achieve a clearly defined\nobjective, such as:\n• increasing shoot growth, root growth,\nflowering, or fruiting\n• establishing newly planted trees and shrubs\n• enhancing foliage color and plant appearance\n• correcting or preventing nutrient deficiencies\nFertilizer Terms\n\"Fertilizer\" means any substance that contains\none or more recognized plant nutrients.\n\"Slow or controlled-release fertilizer\" means a\nfertilizer containing a plant nutrient in a form which\ndelays its availability for plant uptake and use after\napplication, or which extends its availability to the\nplant significantly longer than a reference \"rapidly\navailable nutrient fertilizer,\" such as ammonium\nnitrate or urea, ammonium phosphate, or potassium\nchloride.",

    "content": "Fertilizer Recommendations for Landscape Plants 2\n“Fertilizer grade or analysis” is the percent\nnitrogen, phosphorus and potassium guaranteed by\nthe manufacturer to be in the fertilizer. For historical\nreasons, the nitrogen is expressed as N, the\nphosphorus as P2O5, and the potassium as K2O. The\npercent sign is not used, but instead the numbers are\nseparated by dashes, and the order is always N, P2O5,\nand K2O (e.g. 15-0-15).\nRecommendations and Basic Principles of\nFertilizing Landscape Plants\nThe following recommendations do not pertain\nto products containing insecticides, herbicides or\nother pesticides.\n• Before fertilizing, use soil and/or foliar nutrient\nanalysis to determine whether any need exists for\nphosphorus fertilizer.\n• Before fertilizing, soil may be modified in order\nto improve nutrient uptake or plant responses to\nfertilizer.\n• Fertilizer can increase the severity of some pest\nand other problems to damaging levels. In these\nsituations, the problems should be treated in\nconjunction with fertilization.\n• Soil pH should be considered when selecting\nthe fertilizer.\n• The amount of fertilizer applied should be the\nminimum amount needed to achieve the defined\nobjective.\n• Slow-release fertilizers are preferred, but\nsimilar results can be obtained using small\namounts of soluble fertilizers applied\nfrequently.\n• Read and follow all label instructions and safety\nprecautions.\nWhen to Fertilize\nFertilization may not be required:\n• If homeowners or clients are pleased with the\nappearance of their landscape plants.\n• If plants are established.\n• If plants are flowering or fruiting. Exposure to\nhigh nitrogen at this stage may impede\ndevelopment.\n• For trees, unless nutrient deficiencies exist.\n• In some situations where landscape plants\nexhibit nutrient deficiency symptoms. In many\ninstances, these plants may not be suited for that\nsite due to soil pH, soil drainage, soil salts,\nlimited soil volume, irrigation water quality or\nmineral content of the soil. Consider replacing\nsuch plants with others adapted to site conditions.\nFertilization may be justified in the following\nsituations:\n• If trees and shrubs are newly planted (thus\njustifying fertilization until established).\n• If homeowners or clients desire more or faster\ngrowth.\n• If landscape beds have been leached of\nnutrients by flooding or over-irrigation.\n• If trees and shrubs are not located near fertilized\nturfgrass.\n• If established plants are lacking in foliage color\nor density for the homeowner's or client's\npurposes.\n• If plants exhibiting nutrient deficiencies are in\nsituations where they cannot be replaced with\nmore adapted species.\nHow Much to Fertilize\nGeneral Recommendations:\nWhen it has been determined that fertilization is\nnecessary, most established landscape plants should\nbe fertilized at rates within the ranges listed in table\n1. The number of pounds of various\nnitrogen-containing fertilizers to apply per 1000\nsquare feet of bed area per year is presented in table 2.",

Historically, the ratio of nitrogen (N) to\npotassium (K2O) for landscape plants has been in the\nrange of 1:1 to 2:1. A 15-0-15 is an example of a\nfertilizer utilizing the 1:1 ratio. Due to the prevalence\nof magnesium (Mg) deficiency on certain landscape\nplants in many parts of the state, up to 2.5 pounds\nMg/1000 ft /year may be applied to address this\nproblem. Micronutrients can be applied at specified\nrates and timing to achieve fertilization objectives.\nWater-soluble fertilizers should be applied at no\nmore than 1/2 pound of actual nitrogen per 1000\nsquare feet per application. Application rates of\ncontrolled-release fertilizers depend on release rates\nof the product.\nLandscapes in Which Palms are Important\nPalms have different nutritional requirements\nthan other landscape plants. When palms are\nimportant, landscaped areas within 30 feet of large\nestablished palms should be fertilized with a 4-1-6-2\nMg (N - P2O5 - K2O - Mg) ratio fertilizer (an\n8-2-12-4 Mg is an example of a fertilizer utilizing\nthis ratio). N, K2O, and Mg should have equivalent\npercentages of each nutrient in controlled-release\nform. Using a fertilizer with a ratio other than that\nspecified may induce or accentuate nutrient\ndeficiencies in palms. Fertilization rates may be\nbased on the rates for nitrogen in Table 1, for basic,\nmoderate and high levels of maintenance. Because\npalms are highly prone to several potentially fatal\nmicronutrient deficiencies, any fertilizer applied to\nthem should contain 1-2% Fe and Mn, plus trace\namounts of Zn, Cu, and B to prevent these\ndeficiencies.\nWhere and How to Fertilize\nFertilizer should be broadcast uniformly over the\ndesired areas of the landscape. Consideration shall be\ngiven to root location, fertilization objectives and\nplant species. Areas where tree or shrub fertilization\nzones overlap with lawn fertilization zones should be\nfertilized for one or the other of the plant types, but\nnot both. Foliar applications, injections or implants\nshould only be used when soil application of fertilizer\nis impractical or ineffective in achieving fertilization\nobjectives. When applying foliar fertilizer, the\nfertilizer solution should be sprayed to thoroughly\ncover the affected foliage at the proper stage of\ngrowth to achieve objectives.",

Sivakugan (2000) \t1/11\nChapter 3\nSoil Classification\n3.1 I NTRODUCTION\nSoils can behave quite differently depending on their geotechnical characteristics. In coarse\ngrained soils, where the grains are larger than 0.075 mm (or 75 μm), the engineering\nbehaviour is influenced mainly by the relative proportions of the different sizes present, the\nshapes of the soil grains, and the density of packing. These soils are also called granular\nsoils. In fine grained soils, where the grains are smaller than 0.075 mm, the mineralogy of the\nsoil grains, water content, etc. have greater influence than the grain sizes, on the engineering\nbehaviour. The borderline between coarse and fine grained soils is 0.075 mm, which is the\nsmallest grain size one can distinguish with naked eye.\nBased on grain sizes, the Australian Standards AS1726-1993 groups soils into clays (<0.002\nmm), silts (0.002-0.075 mm), sands (0.075-2.36 mm), gravels (2.36-63 mm), cobbles (63-200\nmm) and boulders (>200 mm). Within these major groups, the soils can still behave quite\ndifferently and we will look at some systematic methods of classifying them into distinct sub-\ngroups.\n3.2 COARSE G RAINED SOILS\nRelative proportions of the different grain sizes have significant influence on the engineering\nbehaviour of a coarse grained soil. Other major factors that influence the geotechnical\ncharacteristics of a coarse grained soil are the density of packing of the soil grains and the\nshape of the soil grains.\nGrain Size Distribution\nThe grain size distribution of a coarse grained soil is generally determined through sieve\nanalysis, where the soil sample is passed through a stack of sieves and the percentages\npassing different sizes of sieves are noted. The grain size distribution of the fines are\ndetermined through hydrometer analysis, where the fines are mixed with distilled water to\nmake 1000 ml of suspension and a hydrometer is used to measure the density of the soil-\nwater suspension at different times. The time-density data, recorded over a few days, is\ntranslated into grain size and percentage finer than that size. Hydrometer analysis is effective\nfor soil fractions down to about 0.5 μm (Das 1994).\nVery often, soils contain both coarse and fine grains and it is necessary to do sieve and\nhydrometer analyses to obtain the complete grain size distribution data. \tHere, sieve analysis\nis carried out first, and on the soil fraction passing 75 μm sieve, a hydrometer analysis is\ncarried out. The grain size data thus obtained from sieve and hydrometer analyses are\ngenerally presented graphically as shown in Fig. 3.1. Logarithmic scale is used for the grain\nsizes since they vary in a wide range. The percentage passing is generally cumulative.\nThe grain size distribution curve shown in Fig. 3.1 gives a complete and quantitative picture\nof the relative proportions of the different grain sizes within the soil mass. D30 is a size such\nthat 30% of the soil grains are smaller than this size. D15, D85, D10, D60, etc. can be defined in\nsimilar manner. D10 is called the effective grain size, which gives a good indication of the",

The grain size distribution curves for such soils would generally be smooth and\nconcave as shown in Fig. 3.1. A sand is well graded if Cu > 6 and Cc = 1-3. A gravel is well\ngraded if Cu > 4 and Cc = 1-3. For the grain size distribution curve shown in Fig. 3.1, D10 =\n0.013 mm, D30 = 0.47 mm, D60 = 7.4 mm, Cu = 569 and Cc = 2.3. Therefore, it is a well\ngraded soil. It can also be seen that this soil contains 53% gravels, 30% sands and 17% fines.\nA soil that is not well graded is poorly graded. Uniform soils and gap-graded soils are\nspecial cases of poorly graded soils. In uniform soils, the grains are about the same size.\n\n-- 2 of 11 --",

For example, in roadworks,\nangular aggregates would provide better interlocking and resistance to get dislodged with\ntraffic.\n3.3 FINE G RAINED SOILS\nWhile the gravels, sands and silts are equi-dimensional (same order of magnitude in all three\ndirections), clay particles are like plates or needles. Their surfaces are electrically charged\ndue to a charge imbalance between the cations and anions within the atomic structure. The\nmicrostructure or microfabric of the clay depends on the mineralogy of the clay and the\nvalence, concentration and the type of the cations present in the pore water.\nClay Mineralogy\nMineralogy and microfabric of the clay structure are studied by x-ray diffraction, differential\nthermal analysis and scanning electron microscope. These sophisticated techniques are,\nhowever, not suitable for the routine geotechnical works. \tAtterberg limits discussed below,\nare directly related to the clay mineralogy and provide a simple means of characterising fine\ngrained soils.\nAtterberg Limits\nThe consistency (degree of firmness. i.e., soft, firm, stiff) of a fine grained soil varies\nsignificantly with the water content. As the water content of a fine grained soil is increased\ngradually from 0%, it goes through different consistencies, namely, brittle solid, semi-solid,\nplastic and liquid states (Fig. 3.4). Atterberg limits are the border line water contents between\ntwo such states. They were developed in early 1900’s by a Swedish soil scientist A.\nAtterberg, \tworking \tin \tceramics \tindustry. \tLater, \tK.Terzaghi \t(in \tlate \t1920’s) \tand \tA.\nCasagrande (early 1930’s) modified them to suit geotechnical works.",

It is the transition water content between\nplastic and liquid states. At liquid limit, the soil has very little strength. Plastic limit (PL or\nwP) is the lowest water content at which the soil exhibits plastic characteristics (i.e., the\nlowest water content at which the clay can be rolled into a 3 mm diameter thread). The range\nof water content, over which the soil remains plastic is called the plasticity index (PI or IP).\nTherefore, PI = LL - PL. Silts are non-plastic and thus PI ≈ 0. Shrinkage limit (SL or wS) is\nthe water content below which a soil sample will not shrink when dried.\nThe Atterberg limits are of empirical nature. However, they had been correlated very well\nwith the geotechnical characteristics of fine grained soils and are therefore very valuable in\nsoil classification.\nLiquidity index (LI or IL) is a parameter used to define the consistency of a fine grained soil\nwith respect to LL and PL. It is defined as:\nLI w \tPL\nLL \tP\n= L\n−\n−\nwhere w is the current water content at which LI is being computed. Some sensitive marine\nclay deposits exist at LI greater than 1 (i.e., at in situ water content greater than LL).\nFine grained soils often contain clays and silts. Here, clays are plastic and silts are non-\nplastic. Therefore, the plasticity index of a fine grained soil will depend on the relative\nproportions of the clays and silts within the soil. Skempton (1953) coined the word \"activity\"\nto separate the plasticity of the clay fraction. Activity (A) is defined as:\nA PI\nof clay\n= %\nActivity is a good indicator of the potential swell-shrink problems associated with a specific\nclay. Higher the activity, higher is the swell-shrink potential. Clays with A<0.75 are\nclassified “normal”; clays where 0.75<A<1.25 are active and clays where A>1.25 are active.",

Sivakugan (2000) \t6/11\n3.4 SOIL CLASSIFICATION\nA soil classification system is a universal language which all the geotechnical engineers\nunderstand, where soils of similar behaviour are grouped together, and \tsystematic and\nrational ways are proposed to classify and describe them. \tThe use of such standard and\nprecise terms eliminates any ambiguity in communicating the soil characteristics. There are\nseveral soil classification systems currently in use. The Unified Soil Classification System\n(USCS) is the most popular one, currently being used in many parts of the world. The\nAASHTO \t(American \tAssociation \tof \tState \tHighway \tand \tTransportation \tOfficials)\nclassification system is quite popular in road works, where the soils are grouped according to\ntheir suitability as subgrade or embankment materials. In Australia, AS 1726-1993 is being\nused in most geotechnical works.\nCoarse and fine grained soils are classified based on grain size distribution\nand Atterberg limits respectively.\nAS 1726 - 1993\nAustralian Standards AS 1726 and the Unified Soil Classification System divide the soils into\nfour major groups, and describe them using standard descriptors. The major soil groups, the\ndescriptors and the recommended symbols are shown in Table 3.1. \tAS 1726-1993\nrecommends describing the soil as “XY”, where the prefix “X” is the major soil group and\nthe suffix “Y” is the descriptor.\nTable 3.1 Soil Groups, Descriptors and Symbols\nMajor Soil Group \tDescriptor\nWell graded (W)\nGravel (G) \tPoorly graded (P)\nSand (S) \tSilty (M)\nClayey (C)\nSilt (M) \tLow plasticity (L)\nClay (C) \tMedium plasticity (I)\nOrganic (O) \tHigh plasticity (H)\nA fine grained soil is classified as clay or silt, depending on the Atterberg limits and not on\nthe percentages. Casagrande (1948) proposed the PI-LL chart shown in Fig. 3.5, where the A-\nline separates the clays and silts. If the LL and PI values of a fine grained soil plot above the\nA-line, it is clay. If they plot below the A-line, the soil is silt. “L”, “I” and “O” symbols are\nused to describe a fine grained soil when LL is less than 35, 35-50 or greater than 50\nrespectively. AS1726-1993 does not recommend “I” for silts. Thus fine grained soils can be\nCL, CI, CH, ML or MH as shown in Fig. 3.5. An organic clay has low plasticity and plots\nbelow the A-line and is assigned a symbol of “OH” or “OL”.

In classifying the soils based on the fine content,\nUSCS has a special case where fine content = 45-55%, in addition to the four cases discussed\nabove. \tWhen the fine content is in the range of 45-55%, the fine grained soils and coarse\ngrained soils are in approximately equal proportions. Here, the soil is assigned a symbol of\nXY-YZ, where X and Y are the symbols for the coarse and fine grained soils respectively. Z\nis the descriptor of the fines (L or H). USCS does not recommend the use of “I” as a\ndescriptor for fines.\n3.5 VISUAL I DENTIFICATION OF SOILS\nA good geotechnical engineer must be able to identify soils in the field simply by the feel.\nCoarse grained soils are easy to identify. Fine grained soils are identified on the basis of\nsome simple tests for dry strength, dilatancy and \ttoughness. Dry strength is a qualitative\nmeasure of how hard it is to crush a dry mass of fine grained soil between the fingers. Clays\nhave very high dry strength and silts have very low dry strength. Dilatancy is an indication of\nhow quickly the moisture from a wet soil can be brought to the surface by vibration. Here, a\npat of moist clay is placed on the palm and struck against the other hand several times. In\nsilty soils, within a few strikes water rises to the surface making it shine. In clays, it may\nrequire considerable effort to make the surface shiny. In other words, dilatancy is quick in\nsilts and slow in clays. Toughness is a qualitative measure of how tough the soil is near its\nplastic limit (where the soil crumbles when rolled to a 3 mm diameter thread). Toughness\nincreases with plasticity. Silty soils are soft and friable (crumble easily) at PL, and clays are\nhard at PL. The fines can also be identified by feeling a moist pat; clays feel sticky and silts\nfeel gritty. The stickiness is due to the cohesive properties of the fines, which is also",
